We stayed in a villa with a private pool which was ok but needs updating and looks tired. The maintenance man even said it’s so hard to keep up with all the hotels issues. The food is bang average not just at the hotel but all round port Douglas. The staff are all great and try and make your stay nice it’s not their fault I just think this is how the hotel is run. 3 stars ,"Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",14 September 2018,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",First family holiday,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",1,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Carrie G,20,4.5,"My family and I recently stayed for 5 nights at the resort, this was our second trip to Sea Temple in 4 months. On our previous visit our room was well presented and clean and we had a lovely holiday. This time was were not given the usual welcome of drink and hand towel. I immediately I noticed how unkept the exteriors of other balconies were being covered in leaves and dirt. Upon entering our room I was seriously disappointed with the quality of the furnishings of which there were few. A lopsided lamp, a battered dining table including broken chair a chipped coffee table and one wall canvas as decoration. The floor was dirty and there was dust over most surfaces. The bed had seen better days and there was hair on our sheets that did not belong to either my husband or I. No spare blankets in cupboard  which was annoying. Upstairs around the spa there was a mismatch of outdoor furniture and a heavy wooden door broken off the BBQ.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",5 September 2018,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Not deserving of 5 star rating,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

We arrived at the hotel a little earlier, however we were allowed to use the facilities and were given pool towels whilst we waited for our room to be ready. We had a very pleasant surprise when we arrived at the room and saw that we had received a complimentary upgrade. Rather than having a Studio Spa Room, we had a 2 bedroom apartment with our plunge pool which was absolutely superb! The breakfast was delicious, the staff were very friendly and the facilities/pool area are great for relaxing. I wouldn't hesitate to book to stay here again.

"1,915 reviews",24,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,granitav,50,4.5,"As we had not been back to the Port for over 20 years, we decided to go back to some warmer weather. We Googled the various hotel sites for PD which included TA, and found Sea Temple which we did not know as apparently it is less than 10 years old. The best deal put us on to Queensland Tourism who had 8 nights for $3200 whilst the hotel direct was asking over $500 per night. The hotel is part of the Pullman group. The site video looked good even though we knew it was 15 to 20 minutes away to the shops etc by shuttle bus.We had flown up via Qantas and did not hire a car this time. The local shuttle service is brilliant and good value. If you are there more than 3 days then get a weekly pass and every time we rang for them to pick us up the longest wait we had was 10 minutes. They even took us and picked us up from church on Sunday and then to the Sunday market after.Occasionally you had to sit in the bus whilst it picked up passengers from all the local resorts and homes but this was also a great way to look at all the resorts and there are many to see. 20 years ago there was only 4 main hotels/resorts for memory and all except 1 are still operating. What we did not know till we arrived was that our apartment was privately owned  (a time share owner) and whilst in the Pullman building it is managed by a local hotel management company and you could not book anything to your room via the hotel. However we had full use of all facilities within the complex, the gym, restaurant ,pool etc but it was pay as you go which was no problem anyway. The restaurant is excellent, great food, great value and great service. The breakfast buffet was OK but rather overpriced compared to other resorts and hotels we have visited recently though lunch and evening meals were better value. Try the Soft blue crab tacos, or the seafood tasting platter, hmmmm!! A good selection of wines  though again were on the expensive side.The apartment was excellent, spacious and fully equipped for self catering. It was in fact a 2 bedroom one but we only booked a one bedroom with the other one closed off but not locked and if extra people stayed it was a further $50 per night.We were on ground level with a swim out porch with safety gate that opened into the moat-like swimming pool that wound around the whole building. It is suitable for children and adults though not over deep but OK for swimming. WiFi was being installed in our room just as we were departing however the Pullman front desk allow you to access their WiFi if needed for no cost. The only real problem you might find is that it is very child friendly and there were lots of them when we were there. No problem night time but during the day don't plan too many naps in the afternoon. There is direct access to the 4 mile beach from inside the complex and you have secure gate key to get back in. Beware that from Nov to May the sea has stingers but none around this trip. The beach is a lovely scenic walk but you need to walk out a long way for serious swimming even when the tide is in. There are countless great value and great food restaurants in town with lots of touristy shops in which to spend. Sunday is the town feature with the Sunday market on the beach at the bottom of the main street adjoining the beautiful quaint and heritage church there. You can even get married there first or second time or have function there. There are personal open garages too for every unit if you drive there. All up a great holiday destination","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",8 August 2018,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",First time experience with Sea Temple Port Douglas,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or15-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",121,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Anders F,30,4.5,"With a price over 500 dollars a night comes high expectations. The Pullman Sea Temple Resort delivers on many, with a luxury feel when looking over the enormous area the resort is situated on. The gigantic pool is apparently one of the largest on the Southern Hemisphere, and it is really gigantic. The rooms/apartments are big and we stayed in a two bedroom with a private plunge pool. However, coming over to the room I must say that much of the luxury feel disappears. The rooms are not well looked after. Spotted tiles, broken wardrobes, a stained sofa, a fridge that at some point must have gotten broken and that has been replaced with one that does not fit to the layout. All these small details that adds up to the feeling that it is not worth the high price tag. From a 5 star rated Pullman resort this comes as a surprise. As for the plunge pool it was only used by the kids late at night. There is no sun being let through because of shading, which for Scandinavian sun seekers is not much welcomed. Breakfast was also a disappointment given the high price. The same place serving food at night was somewhat better - again very high priced compared to what you will get outside. We enjoyed our stay but goes back with the feeling that we overpaid a lot compared to what we could have gotten elsewhere.

We asked a room attendant about the smell on our last day and was told a machine could be put in to clean the air. Why did we have to ask? This should have been done before our arrival.

"1,915 reviews",8,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Vanessa K,40,4.5,"For a 5 star resort some things could be improved. Check in did take some time, both employees were busy which can't be helped. We were asked to take a seat which was very thoughtful, however we were then forgotten three families were then assisted and checked in we then went back up to the desk and were checked in after that. On our first morning there was a number of bottles, pizza boxes and dirty dishes at one of the tables on the way to the restaurant clearly from the night before - this one not the only occurrence of this happening. On our last night we had room service (food was delicious), we noticed ants and understand this can't be avoided given the climate. Because of this we called and asked for our plates to get collected rather than leaving them over night and notified the staff why. It was quite late, we waited 20 minutes no-one came to collect the plate we placed the plates outside our room, it was still there the next morning. The breakfast was delicious (all of their food was good), however the service was really lacking in the morning, 3 out of the 4 mornings we had to approach staff members to order off their menu for eggs and coffee but were told we had to wait at our table to be served. I'm happy to order at a counter - but if required to order at a table it would be best for staff to be available. The bathroom was bigger than the living space. The view nothing special for the spa suite, being the lowest room we however didn't expect much. Comfortable enough room. Finally I also felt there was a lack of suitable places to sit around the pool some seats but all in the sun - the majority of the pool is surrounded by rooms (I'm glad we didn't stay in one of these as you are quite often on display as soon as your on your balcony or in your living space if the blinds are up - however this is a personal preference). Depends on what you are looking for and what you feel makes a five star resort, however I felt that given their reviews and rating I was left a little disappointed.

We would love to return to this hotel on our next visit to Port Douglas. My only criticism would be the ""cocktail"" served at happy hour was definitely not of the standard that I would expect from a luxury hotel. It was more like flat post mix soft drink with a shot of alcohol. As someone who appreciates the finer details, this was a very noticeable drop in quality to me. We had a rental car and there was garage parking provided for all guests. The resort is located out of town and if you want to explore this beautiful region I recommend hiring a car.

"1,915 reviews",46,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,ExploretoDiscover,50,4.5,"Good choice.  We left other accommodation early and moved here, only for one night but took a two-bedroom apartment with rooftop bbq and spa tub.  What a change from where we were previously.  This was an interim night before moving (again) to other pre-booked accommodation.  Fabulous two-bedroom apartment with two bathrooms.  I was the fifth person - on a rollaway bed but that was king single size with a decent mattress, linen and a light doona – ticked the boxes for me for one night.  A set of towels was omitted but quickly rectified by Reception.  Shower pressure amazing and the spa bath in the ensuite attached to the main bedroom was fantastic.  Bring some bath salts or buy some at the resort spa and indulge in a spa bath.  This apartment wasn’t ground floor but was two levels with the rooftop BBQ and outdoor spa tub.  The apartment underneath was swim out to the massive swimming lagoon.  Parking was reasonably close although confusing about the garage allocation – as some looked to be permanently inhabited so we parked in a visitor spot.  There was choice of a lift or stairs – so no lugging suitcases and other stuff up flights of stairs to get to your room.  We didn’t have time to try the restaurant option – opting to use the BBQ after buying the most amazing pre-prepared seafood platters (in Port Douglas) following by BBQ coral trout and prawns.  The BBQ is a Weber and there is a small kitchen preparation area on the rooftop.  It’s a spiral staircase from the apartment up to the rooftop and you do need to carry your plates up the staircase but it was all pretty easy.  Nothing like a feast of seafood, a warm spa and a BBQ to top a long day off!  No charge for pool towels here – and the pool is absolutely amazing.  The lower level accommodation has many rooms with direct swim out access and give the kids a noodle and they can explore – it’s not a lazy river but there is enough pool to almost lose yourself.  If you are a lap swimmer then there is also enough space to get a rhythm up without bumping into anyone – down the main part of the pool – from the pool bar to Reception.  Pretty happy all round.  Happy hour drinks (I think from 5-6 pm from memory) had champagne at $6.00 which warrants more than one!  We didn’t have time to test the breakfast – some of the group were doing a reef cruise and I tested the onsite spa with a facial.  Check out time is a decent 11:00 am but noted that there is nil food service at that time of day – when we asked at the restaurant area if there were any options we were advised the kitchen is closed between end of breakfast and start of lunch service.  We opted to head into Port Douglas for brunch after checking out – otherwise we would have been happy to spend our money at the resort, another oh well moment.  I’d be happy to stay here again, just for the amazing pool!","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",12 June 2018,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Amazing pool!

"1,915 reviews",1,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,vanessa c,20,4.5,It's frustrating when a resort holds itself out as '5 star' but is not. When we arrived there was an airconditioning issue. Our entire villa floor was slippery with condensation. The relevant staff arrived over the course of 48hrs to try and fix. On the first night we decided to order room service. We paid approx $170 for some appetisers and 3 pizzas. It was B grade and in some cases inedible. Due to work commitments we had expected to be able to access the Internet from our room. It was then a comedy of errors to try and connect. We were never able to do so from our room but were encouraged to join a particular club so that it was free! This was probably the most disappointing aspect. It caused much angst over our holiday because some tasks that would have been straight fwd in the normal course became impossible or protracted and took away from family time. If we had known there would be no internet access from our room we would have made alternative arrangements. The villa was tired. Furniture looked unclean or was in need of replacement. We asked whether the outdoor table might be replaced as it was not functional and we were told that other guests had complained but unfortunately there was no other option at this stage. We travel a lot and this is the first time that we felt strongly enough to write a review so others can avoid disappointment.

We did the walk to another resort for an outstanding dinner (Chapter One) and back with no problems. Conference dinner at Pullman was also disappointing- once again inflexible- and only one staff member assigned , Kara, who did an excellent job in the difficult circumstances. Last day of stay saw a blocked toilet, ending a disappointing stay.  I also saw room service plates left outside rooms all day.

"1,915 reviews",1,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,CLane119,40,4.5,"A lovely resort. The location for us was a little bit to far out of the main hub. If it was located closer to town we would stay again. It was hard with children not being able to pop down easily to shops etc (the shuttle should be free). The pools are fantastic and excellent set up for children.  I see it more as a family resort.  We stayed in room 128 which is a great location for little children as the water is shallow. Being honest the food is not up to a 5 star experience - breakfast each morning was excellent however apart from that everything else was pretty average at the restaurant. We had room service a couple of times & each time it took a couple of days for tray/dishes to be collected even though staff would walk past & see it sitting outside. Maintenance and a clean up of gardens/resort is needed for it to be rated 5 star, also the apartments in my opinion are not 5 star at all. Two of the restaurant staff at breakfast were fantastic along with the pool bar man however many others seemed unmotivated and almost a hassle if we asked anything. House keeping were EXCELLENT. A lovely holiday with our family.

"1,915 reviews",70,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Michelle G,50,4.5,"Huge wow factor when checking in.  Wide, breezy open reception area which was tastefully decorated.  The rough driveway entry added to the disconnect from the surrounding suburb to sometime exotic.  Ample temporary parking out the front.  Check in was swift and received a lot of information about almost everything.  Received a room upgrade to a 2 bedroom villa/apartment which thankfully had lift access.  Parking was at random (and free) - either in a vacant garage or one of the many visitor spots.  A larger vehicle like a big 4 wheel drive may have found parking a challenge.  The villa's fully catered kitchen was larger than my own with quality appliances and plenty of cleaning accessories.  Bedrooms were not huge my any means but still manoeuvrable. The ensuite had double vanity basins but little room around them to place personal items, a very large spa bath and separate show and toilet.  Lots of hanging space in the robes.  The lounging areas inside and out were spacious and enticed lounging.  The roof top entertainment area which included a hot tub and BBQ was a great place to relax in the early evening whilst watching the local bird life go through their nightly routine.  Finding the resort in the dark was challenging without a navigation device although it is well signposted as I discovered the next day.  The resort pool is huge and entices 'laziness'.  Breakfast was buffet with cooked eggs to order.  Catered for a diverse range of diets. The bar  offered mocktails which could be sipped whilst pool gazing.  Only booked for 4 night when it should have been around 6-7 so I could have sampled the day spa menu.  Couldn't fault the resort and the staff. The resort however is some distance from the CBD of Port Douglas and hence a need for some form of transport.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",17 April 2018,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Wonderful tropical resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or70-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

We drive from Cairns and arrived to....nothing. No one greeted us upon arrival and we hauled all of our suitcases out of the car and dragged them through the Lobby ourselves only to be told we needed to put them back in the car ourselves and take them to our room ourselves. Not a huge deal but not the nicest welcome to a supposed 5-Star resort. Our room (a 2-br pool access room) was very basic, again not a huge deal but not what would be expected by a 5-Star resort, the issue was the cleanliness. Bugs on the floor, stained, worn, dirty furniture, hairs on the sheets, stained bedding and dirty towels. Definitely not acceptable (photos attached). We called to ask Room Service to come clean and change towels and went to have lunch at the hotel restaurant. We were the only table inside, there were 3-4 tables outside having drinks. We ordered our food and waited..and waited for over an hour. No bread or drinks were brought. 2 waiters came by after an hour to apologise for taking so long but still no food. After 90 minutes our order came —1 pizza, 1 pasta, 1 chicken fingers, 1 burger & 1 chicken burger. After the long wait we were hoping for some good food—it didn’t happen. The chicken and burgers were fatty and tasteless. The pizza was obviously microwave pizza and the fries tasted like they’d been fried in old oil. The pasta was ok but certainly not amazing.

"1,915 reviews",20,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Mary S,40,4.5,"This is a stunning resort about 1.5 hour drive from airport. The pool, 4 mile beach area, and restaurant were highlights. I can't give it 5 stars due to cleanliness and communication. The pool area needed some clean up and our rooms were not properly cleaned leaving dirty dishes and sheets on the floor. Unexcusable for a resort at this level. The water main broke down while we were there and no notice was provided when we returned from our outing. I don't fault the resort for something it had no control but I do think they could have considered communicating this to guests returning to their rooms after a hot day. Some discipline is definitely needed as the grounds are worth the effort.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",4 March 2018,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Three Day stop with mixed results,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or90-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",35,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,robandmirry,40,4.5,"My husband decided a weekend away at Sea Temple Port Douglas would be wonderful for my 50th Birthday - he also decided that a one bedroom penthouse would be suitable for us.  We had two nights of indulgence at the hotel but there were a few things that did make the experience somewhat lackluster.  The apartment was great - we were upgraded to a two bedroom and it faced the golf course which was nice and quiet - away from the noise of the pool.  The apartment itself was comfortable and clean.  However - the shower proved to be extremely difficult to get in and out of - the bath edge was very high and the tap was placed well past the glass panel.  The water pressure was pretty poor but the little touches were pretty cool.  We did not have soap for the first night - but did receive a comb - but not on the second night.  The toiletries are of a high quality and I enjoyed using them.  The kitchen is well thought out - but you end up with the littlest coffee plunger but no coffee - all instant stuff - which is a shame for a 5 star hotel.  The milk in the fridge was a small long life thing - which is extremely disappointing for a 5 star resort.  It costs you $35.00 for 24 hours of movies and they do offer free wi-fi for a limited time only and not for streaming. You can however purchase more expensive packages.  The roof area of the penthouse was huge - with a spa and BBQ area which we used the first night.  However, we were there in February and the spa was HOT.  Really?  February and it was HOT?  We turned it off over night so that we may be able to use it the next day - but someone turned it back on and it was too hot to use again.  Kinda spoilt the whole idea of a spa.  The pool area slightly makes up for it tho.  Beautiful pool - very very clean and comfortable areas to lounge.  Breakfast was OK - but the scrambled eggs sucked - they were watery.  And a huge disappointment - no eggs benedict.  All the other items were OK - Smoked salmon was great and the yogurt stand was fantastic.  Coffee - well don't go to the machine hoping for a good coffee - but you can order one.  We also paid for a Mywine card for $49.00 each and as we did not receive any real information regarding this offer - we turned up at the restaurant to be told ""we don't usually do this"" and were informed we could choose between three cocktails or wine and beer and an entree.  We found out too late it was for bar time at sundown - if we had known we would have spent two wonderful hours by the pool.  So really it was a waste of money for us.  This may sound negative, but really we had a great stay - next time - if there is a next time we will be more organised and know that we should have received more information from Accor before taking on the Mywine offer.  If you are planning a romantic getaway - this is a great place - particularly if you have an Accor card - however not once were we offered a free bottle of wine with our dinner - and I thought this was an extra for dining at the restaurant.  It was cheap because we received 50% off - food was good - especially the pork belly entree but very disappointed in spending the money on the Mywine card.  As a part of the Accor membership we received a ""welcome drink"".  It turned out to be beer or wine or softdrink.  You may be thinking this is a terrible - but really we had a great time and will do it again.  We will more organised next time - knowing what to expect - and we will get the Mywine card again.  Because it really was great value - we just did not receive the information needed to make it work.  So - whatever you do - try this hotel because you will like but remember - it is out of the way - no where near the township of Port Douglas - but we did love it and will do it again.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",2 March 2018,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",50th Surprise.,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or90-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",25,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,QuestandRest,40,4.5,"I travel to Port Douglas once a month and decided to try the Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple. Pulling up, you immediately get a sense of wow, with a grand reception area, reminiscent of a Phuket resort. Check-in is very friendly and efficient. I am a Le Club member which meant I could attend the welcome drinks event, hosted by the hotels friendly and professional GM. This is a great initiative that runs between a set time in the afternoon, bringing together arriving guests and hotel management. After a wine and some finger food, I headed off to the room. It was beautifully appointed, clean and well maintained. I have stayed twice at the hotel and the only slightly annoying part is parking. The parking spots are scattered around the grounds and when busy can mean you have a bit of a walk to your room. It's pot luck how close you get and if raining can be a soggy start to your stay. Honestly, this is a minor point and clearly did not affect my return to the property. A nice thing to do in the morning or evening is to take the path to the beach. Its a beach away from the main part of town so frequented more by locals and dog walkers. It's a slice of paradise and very relaxing. A walk before breakfast is highly recommended. As I have found with the Pullman chain, the breakfast offer is extensive, pretty but fairly bland. I was surprised to find the horrible push button coffee was free but I was charged for the slightly better barista made coffee. I thought brand standard included coffee. Breakfast is beside the pool amongst the gardens. You would be hard pressed to find a prettier spot to start the day. Clearly I enjoyed my stay at the Pullman. It is efficient, friendly and luxurious, set amongst tropical gardens next to a picturesque beach. What more could you ask for. Have it on your list of Port Douglas hotels to consider if heading to the area.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",2 December 2017,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Luxury and Class in Port Douglas,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or130-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

Our penthouse was great, couldn’t fault the actual room in any way. The pool at the resort is brilliant, other rooms open up onto the pool which is cool albeit lacking privacy.

The bathroom was adequate with a shower with good drainage and pressure although the tub itself was a bit high and I had to be careful getting in and out each time. Guests can also park their cars inside the resort at no additional cost. Service at reception was friendly and courteous. Other reviews have mentioned that the hotel itself seemed a little run down and could use some renovating. A highlight though was the outdoor area and spiral staircase leading up to the jacuzzi and barbecue area, complete with sun beds where we enjoyed our afternoons sunbathing. You can also access this area from outside. The Sea Temple is perfect for families with young children with child-lock gates everywhere so it can also get a bit noisy with all the children outside. I am dazzled by the pool which was described to us as the 3rd largest in the southern hemisphere. This  is not in the town centre but is only a short drive and I believe much better than other offerings in town. We tried the restaurant one night and it was OK but there are many restaurants in town as well, which seemed to be better.

The laundry was nice to have and the full kitchen was also a bonus as food is expensive in Australia and eating at the restaurant is prohibitive.  We had our own grill along with an outdoor eating area and enjoyed hamburgers and hot dogs there.  The outdoor lounge area was great to monitor the kids while they were in the pool.  I do recommend against spending the money for the plunge pool in winter.  It wasn't heated and while the kids still got in it wasn't comfortable.  The larger resort pool was also cool but fine.  Would have liked a play area for the kids, but they didn't have any problems coming up with their own games.

Considering the price we paid for 5 nights and the location of the resort, we were not expecting it to be mostly taken up by families. Our travel agent even suggested this place because it would be more designed for couples. We did stay during the school holidays, go figure, but being school teachers we didn't have much choice. The spar was always full of children, the deck chairs were always full of families and the pool was bombarded with kids too! It wasn't a huge issue, but it would have made all the difference if there was an adult only zone or better supervision of the outdoor space. The restaurant is honestly, very average. The breakfast buffet is not worth $35 each!! We've stayed at Hyatt resorts in Hawaii and the service there along with the food is on a much higher level - it's also cheaper!

E.G. only one type of newspaper available to read, and that was basic local one.  Every day the activities notice broad had the exact same thing on: ""swim in the pool"" and ""happy hour"". I have attached the photo. Clearly no effort put into arranging activities. If you are looking for a resort that offers you more than  pool, e.g. yoga, or tennis, or kids activities, this is not it. There are bikes but you have to pay to hire them. Having said that the apartments are some of the nicest I have seen, very stylish and very comfortable, so you can enjoy them. However, the apartments are piled up one next to and on the other so if you want peace and quiet this isn't the place for you. However, it is just a short walk to the beautiful beach where you can find endless tranquility.

Room was clean and well appointed, however we were not a fan of the open bathroom concept with little toilet privacy except for an opaque glass swinging door. Also 2 days in a row asked for cereal bowls to be placed in room and was never done. The lagoon pool is really nice. Perfect for kids if you have them, but no alternative adult pool if that's your preference. The property is set up more like resort style flats/condos - personally I wasn't a fan of having to walk through/around parking lot to get to front desk and restaurant. The set up works well if you're private and don't like staff knowing your coming and goings, also convenient for just getting in your car and driving off property. Sad to say our most disappointing meal in Port Douglas was at Aqua. Our server was wonderful, it was the meal. My partner had the chicken supreme and enjoyed it. I had the duck - it was overcooked and the portion tiny. The first time in a long time I left a restaurant hungry. We did enjoy the breakfast buffet. If you order room service for breakfast be aware the prices on the hanging door menu don't match up with the larger printed room service menu. A $10-11 difference in the ""Australian Breakfast"" - the door hanging menu being higher than the large printed menu. Front desk staff were helpful in adjusting my bill at checkout when error was presented. Management probably needs to review print materials in rooms for consistency. Overall our stay was pleasant. I think a family with children though would enjoy it more. As a kid I would have been in heaven with the lagoon pool.

"1,915 reviews",16,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,grace255060,30,4.5,"We recently stayed at the Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa for 8 nights in a 2 Bedroom Swim Out Apartment.  The apartment was compact with only one bathroom.  The shower was over the bath which is virtually unheard of these days.  The glass sliding door on the shower broke a couple of times rendering it impossible to get in or out.  Whenever anyone had a shower the exhaust fan couldn't handle it, and there was massive condensation throughout the bathroom.  Maintenance came and fixed/cleaned the exhaust fan which was thick with dust.  We were informed that the power for this was shared with 5 other apartments & that was as good as it gets in the tropical climate.  The apartment was generally rundown & grubby, noticeable dust on the overhead fans, skirting boards, behind toilet and corners that obviously hadn't been cleaned in some time. We always wore shoes as if we walked around in bare feet they would be filthy.  The furniture was stained and grubby and smelt stale.  The walls and doors were marked and scuffed.  This is obviously a ""resort"" that caters for families with young children as it was clear that they had the run of the place.  Forget getting near the pool spa, as it was full of pre-schoolers wearing floaties (not sure where their parents were).  They could probably capitalise more during the high season on age appropriate activities for teenagers.  My experience in staying in 4-5 star hotels/resorts is that gardening & maintenance staff are usually out cleaning & sweeping public areas & the pools early in the morning.  I didn't ever see anyone sweeping or cleaning, & the spa was clearly full of dirt and sand.  Despite booking in January, we were given an apartment that was only a few metres opposite the pool bar, making privacy virtually impossible.   We paid just over $5,000 for 8 nights and if we hadn't paid upfront I would have checked out. I have a friend who recently stayed at this resort in a Studio Room and she said her room had obviously just been freshened up as it was lovely.  Clearly this hasn't been extended to the Swim Out Apartments.   Despite this, the restaurant staff were extremely friendly and obliging, especially when my husband brought back a fish he had caught that they cooked for us.  Overall, the Pullman undoubtedly was a great resort and with the right amount of time and money spent, still has the potential to be great.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",7 July 2017,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ","Disappointing for a ""5 Star Resort""!",https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or215-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

Second floor was a huge outdoor empty space with a small jacuzzi in the corner. Space would be good for a big group but seemed a bit open for a couples getaway. No ensuite off the main bedroom. Main bathroom was disappointing with a shower over the bath. Cleaners were quite slack (dead cockroaches in the kitchen) and service at the restaurant was very slow - the bar man appeared lost. Food was good though. Location of the resort is fantastic and definitely go for a walk out the back to the beach it's beautiful!

However a very convenient shuttle bus operates more or less on demand for $5 per person (one-way). They will pick you up if you call them and service is door to door.

The apartment was perfect, and the housekeeping service was attentive and detailed. The resort itself is simply the perfect retreat for the family. The lagoon pool is one of the best we've ever seen; great central pool, surrounded by a wonderful winding lagoon which the kids loved exploring. The poolside bar is great (even if the food menu is a little limited), with fantastic cocktails and great service. There was nothing beyond the abilities of the front desk staff to organise.

Took 3 days to try and resolve, first managed I spoke to was a man who clearly did not have a ounce of customer service to the point he was getting very aggressive and confrontational. Then it was dealt with by a lady manager who offered us some money but it was half of what the items cost. They looked on the records for the key fob on the door and the only people that had been in our apartment when our items were taken were the maids. But more disturbing was me and another parent caught a man in the bushes taking pictures of the kids.

When I called to enquire about parking space I was told they could offer me an early check in of 1pm which I thought was great. As our flight got into Cairns early, we planned some side trips and things to do to keep us occupied till 1pm. Decided to buy some fresh food for lunch in our villa once we checked in. Arrived at reception only to be told villa was not ready, check in time was 3pm and they can't guarantee requests like ours. I informed them that I didn't request this, I was OFFERED this and that I was not impressed. Anywhere else we've stayed at, 95% of time we've been able to check in early without even requesting it, or they would ring to find out how much longer it may take - but not staff here. So I got a call at 3pm to say villa was now ready. The villa itself was lovely and we enjoyed the pool, however, the overall experience with initial contact at reception will certainly deter us from staying again. I would have expected more from a resort where you are paying top dollar......but I've learnt not to expect that  from an Accor property as we've had similar experiences in other Accor properties.

All the buses for any activity you want pick you up right in front which is so convenient. The rooms are spacious, clean with comfortable beds and a good kitchen.  The pool is not great for swimming but, is interesting since it goes around the whole place. I would have liked a little bigger area to swim in though. I really loved all the breakfast choices and never had the same thing the whole time I was there. My biggest disappointment was that one day they had all these different antioxidant heathy juices for breakfast and I thought I had not seen them the first day there only to realize they weren't offered every day.

"1,915 reviews",5,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Liana R,20,4.5,"Far from Being 5 Star. Very disappointed. If it wasn't for the beautiful main pool which is just superb, we would have checked out. We had originally booked our own ""Private Plunge Pool Apartment"" which we were to to find out upon arrival that it was far from ""Private"". The apartment next door could access our pool as there is no gate or fence to stop anyone from entering. When I questioned reception I was told that it was with faith that the people next door would not enter into our private area. NOT GOOD ENOUGH!!!! I paid for a PRIVATE Plunge Pool!!!!! The bathroom was atrocious, shower plug was black & mouldy that we would have had to wear thongs to shower. The basin was all cracked and worn badly. The toilet flush button & toilet brush holder is rusted and full of green mould. The whole place was grotty. The private pool wall was mouldy and black which gives you the  impression that there was black running water into the pool from it. Very uninviting.  Eeek who would want to swim in that! We asked to move apartment & finally after 2 hours they moved us to a Penthouse Apartment which the inside was much cleaner & maintained but the Spa bath surrounding area is black and grotty with cobwebs and mould. When we complained about this, the actual Managers reply was ""You are welcome to Check Out if you are unhappy"". ""WHAT- ARE YOU SERIOUS, ISNT THIS A 5 STAR RESORT? Atrocious comment from a Manager. No wonder the staff are all so laid back and non attentive. It comes from the top!!! The whole place needs a good Pressure Wash and Clean.

Towels for the pool need to be brought from your room (again not that bad - but not 5 star).  The spa closed at 5:30 each night - very frustrating as the place is called a resort and spa.

The reviews that complain about everything not being perfect are being whingers. The service is impeccable and the pool doesn't disappoint. I think I have fairly high expectations and it was clean and just went on and on. Loved it. I wasn't rapt in the breakfast. They need to ditch the auto pancake maker and something was seriously wrong with the banana smoothies that even the chef was confused by! The rest was pretty average at best but wouldn't take much to freshen it all up. The room facilities for cooking and even laundry are top quality so if you get a few supplies in town you can just make food to eat on your gorgeous balcony or inside in the extreamly well appointed apartment.  We were just blissfully happy with our stay. My Tip is you stay here is to get a few day pass for the shuttle to town (or have a car). The shuttle is so convenient and amount of days on the pass aren't consecutive so you can use it as much as you want on a day you decide and and then skip days till you need it again and  just call them to pick up.

We loved it because it was very clean and very comfortable for all of us. Loved the washer and dryer because it was the middle of our 15 day Australian vacation.

We met some very nice employees at the Christmas buffet and they were working hard to ensure everyone was having a great experience. No complaints at all here.

We queried changing our swim out pool location and instead we were offered an upgrade to a private Villa which was not only unexpected but fantastic.  We were advised restaurants to try and all were as recommended.  Breakfast was great, the bar was great, room servicing was great.  We just couldn't fault our time here again.  It is interesting reading some of the negative reviews here.  Being here twice we haven't encountered any of the negativity that gets mentioned.

We searched around and came across the Pullman on the internet so we drove there walked into the foyer and I was sold just had such a great feeling.  Spoke with Anthony on the Desk fantastic service, told him what we had experienced at the mirage and wanted to see what they had available being told they only had 1 room type available feeling a little deflated at the thought we may not be able to stay he drove us around to the room, which just happened to be a 3 bedroom villa, with a plunge pool, bbq area massive open plan lounge dine and kitchen and just a great feeling.  It was 30 seconds walk to the beach and 30 seconds walk to the sensational pool.  The price with breakfast was on par with what we were paying at the mirage for a 2 bedroom villa with a mouldy ceiling in the bathroom and 5 mins walk to the Pool. We jumped at the villa and our holiday was back on track.  The buffet breakfast was great the staff friendly and helpful.  There was a Nespresso machine in the room which even had decaf pods.  When these ran out I called the front desk to see if I can come and collect some more less then 10 minutes later they were delivered to the villa. Tui at the Pool bar is great I was amazed at her skills during happy hour.

On entering the room, there was a strong musty odour. We complained to reception, and were given a candle to light. This did nothing. So we bought incense sticks as the odour was so over powering/ unpleasant. I complained to management- we had to vacate the room for one hour while they 'treated' the room. While doing this they found the fan in my bathroom wasn't working, so fixed that. Odour was initially better- then came back. On our fourth day in the apartment- I found mould - lots of it- on the back of the three blinds in my bedroom! ...the last thing I needed after my lung operation- and the last thing I expected at a supposedly 5 star establishment.  I complained immediately, and the blinds were taken down and cleaned or replaced. The room smelt totally different. The apartment we were allotted was a health risk- totally unacceptable. In addition, my booking was for two adults. Our apartment was not a swim out.... but a walkout into knee deep water in the toddlers pool area. Coming to rest and recuperate, to be woken at 7.30 each morning with children / babies/ parents playing / splashing outside my bedroom wasn't great either. We had to walk quite some distance in knee deep water before the water was deep enough to swim.

Was upgraded to a penthouse apartment which was in great spot with central walk to the pool, restaurant and beach. Had spa on the roof deck which got good use as the main pool is not heated and if day is overcast pool little bit cold; may want to time trip to warmer month if want full advantage of the large pool. Room was good and beds comfortable, maybe little tired but otherwise very comfortable. Is little ways out of the main street so if have young kids would definitely need your own car. Staff very friendly and seems to have few backpackers working in restaurant. Was able to use rewards card in restaurant, just can be bit slow dependent on staff. Main downside was internet would fail when in restaurant; do find it useful when on holidays to give ipad to child as a distraction so get moments peace and quiet to enjoy dinner with wife. Booked some tours through reception and charged to room which made hassle free. Would come back again but maybe in Sep instead of Aug to get better use of the pool.

The Pullman Sea Temple has a vast and beautiful pool complex because you can't swim on the beach because of the stingers(poisonous jelly fish), crocodiles, and sharks. The Sea Temple setting is exotic with lanterns lit amongst the rainforest garden setting, as the sun sets. Many babymooners seem to come here along with newly weds, young families and international visitors. Delicious cocktails can be enjoyed at Happy Hour prior to enjoying an excellent meal at the in house restaurant Aqua. Our room overlooked the swimming pool had a huge square spa and a balcony. The room was extremely comfortable and big enough for 2 people. If you would like something bigger the ground floor apartments with direct entry to the pool may be for you.Unfortunately the noise of squealing children playing in the pool at 7.00am did carry up to the room.

"1,915 reviews",30,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Ken B,30,4.5,"This hotel is marketed as a luxury property and really is more an average property.  We stayed in one of the 3 bedroom ""beach front"" villas.  While the villas are the closest thing to the beach, they are not truly beachfront.  You need to access the beach via a common boardwalk, several units down from ours, quite a ways through the mangroves.  The beach is extremely narrow and seems as maybe it has been washed away over time.  The unit itself was quite adequate in size (we were in unit 306) however the furnishings were extremely worn and seemed like they needed to be cleaned.  You could tell from the entry gate to the unit which did not close properly, the window locks that did not work, the plunge pool fountain that was inoperable, and the burned out lights in the water features in the unit that the maintenance for the facility was extremely lacking.  We were in the middle of a two week vacation so the laundry facilities in the unit were nice to have.  This lack of maintenance and care was also noticeable throughout the resort as the poolside chairs and furniture were clearly in need of refurbishment and the plastic barware they used at the pool seemed dirty as it was so worn with use.  With respect to the distance from town, there is a very convenient shuttle service that picks up right in front of the property.  However, traveling with a family of 5 at $5 AUD per person each way, it certainly adds quite a bit to a dinner out with the family.  One other thing that makes the hotel difficult is getting around from the lobby to the rooms to the pool bar.  There is no direct route anywhere and signage is lacking or non-existent for someone unfamiliar with the property.  On one evening, the hotel had what looked like a corporate event right off the lobby and the pool and one had to literally walk through the event to get to the front of the lobby.  Awkward to say the least.  The staff was as pleasant as you would find at any other middle of the road hotel, but it does not stand up to the service that you would find at a fine luxury resort.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",5 August 2016,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ","Tired, Overpriced, and Too far from Town",https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or470-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

The best part was when we reported the cockroach situation to the front desk, the response was, oh, well, yeah this happens in humid areas.

"1,915 reviews",4,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Edphilrich,30,4.5,"Our first night at this expensive resort was not a positive experience. We were allocated one of the worst swim out rooms in this resort, Rm 145. The room had a a damp smell, and opening it up made no difference. It was sunless, and faced a pedestrian bridge - losing privacy. It did not have direct access to the pool. Further, the furnishings were a disgrace for a 5-star experience, with damaged or discoloured fittings such as damaged lamp shades that need replacing. The beds were comfortable but the staff were unable to find a bottom sheet that actually fitted properly. (Strangely for a five star place, the sheets were not changed everyday unless you asked - which we did - and even then they were reluctant to change them more then once every 3 days!) The Front Office manager agreed to move us into a new apt the next day thankfully, though it was not very sunny despite his claim to the contrary. One of the problems at this Pullman resort, which is not reflective of other Pullmans we've seen, is that a number of the apartments are leased or owned privately, and quality seems to vary from room to room as a result. The restaurant is over priced with a limited menu and most patrons seem to eat out. On a positive note, the staff, especially the non-management staff, were all very pleasant. In sum, the Pullman Sea Temple is a lovely place with a superb pool, with great potential, but they do need to make some significant improvements in basic areas...it starts with management training and doing right by the high paying customer.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",24 July 2016,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Management prevents a five star experience at this lovely resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or485-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",34,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Frances A,50,4.5,"Visited this resort a few years ago before it became a Pullman. Had to try staying there. I am a long term Advantage Plus (Gold) member and when I booked in for a 2 night stay in a Studio Spa Room, I felt at $399 per night, it was a little expensive. However the hotel seemed very upmarket so I decided to ""bight the bullet"" and go for it. A week before our booked dates Trip Advisor had an advertisement for the same room at a much lower rate. This is a bit disappointing when Advantage Plus members are supposed to get the cheapest rate available. Anyway on contacting the Hotel we were offered an upgrade to a 2 bedroom Penthouse Apartment (for the same $399 per night). And the Apartment was fantastic. Lovely lounge area, kitchen, 2 bathrooms, upstairs area with BBQ and Jacuzzi and balcony overlooking meandering pool and beautiful gardens. Room was a fair walk from the restaurant but the staff, on request, will come and pick you up in an golf buggy like vehicle. I have to say the staff everywhere, including the cleaning staff, those in the reception area and restaurant were amazingly helpful and friendly. Loved staying there. Only two small suggestions / criticisms. Each Penthouse should have its own designated car parking spot. It should not be first come first served when you are paying the extra for a Penthouse. Secondly when paying $32 pp for a Buffet Breakfast you shouldn't find on your bill, separate $4 charges for a glasses of Tomato Juice. At the very least you should be informed of the charge. I know I am sounding like I am tight but when you are paying good money, small hidden charges are annoying to me.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",22 July 2016,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Lovely Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or490-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

Apart from lights and a hinge here and there that need replacing (which we reported and they were on to it), and a shocking family we had staying next door to us who were not really suited to 'resort style' living, we had a lovely stay. Found the studio room quite roomy except for our luggage, but still managed to move things around to suit! The pool is really what sets the scene of 'holiday' here, but with a new general manager in place who obviously has her sights on overlooking everything, we found the service outstanding.

"1,915 reviews",18,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,ellsberg2015,20,4.5,"This resort came highly recommended. I am not a complainer for the sake of it, however, we have been here for one night (of six) and are very disappointed with the experience and service. The only request we had made upon booking was a king size bed. When we arrived, our room wasn't ready so we went to the bar for a drink and a late lunch after travelling all day. Our drinks arrived, but the food didn't come...at all. After more than 45 minutes, we questioned staff who realized that they hadn't even put the order in. By this time our room was ready so we decided to forgo the food. They tried to rectify it by giving us a drinks voucher to the restaurant, so we accepted. We then made our way to the room - in the far corner of the resort away from the pool. The keys hadn't been activated so my husband had to walk back to reception to activate them. We eventually opened the door to discover a room with a queen size bed. We called reception and another hour later we were in a new room - still far from the pool area, but now with the king bed. Given that all the advertising we have seen revolves around the pool / lagoon and that we are here for 6 nights, we asked if it might be possible to have a room near the pool. They said to check back the next day. So here we are - I called today at around 1 o'clock and the receptionist said she was with someone and would call me back. Over three hours later, I still haven't received a phone call. I spoke to the assistant manager in person who said a pool room isn't available. So, I guess we'll unpack now. However, this is supposed to be a great time away for our 20th wedding anniversary. For a highly rated resort we have had a very poor experience. My recommendation is that if you are booking at the Sea Temple Port Douglas, be very specific about the location of your apartment and don't assume that what is advertised is what you'll get. We are overlooking the road / golf course. First impressions are important - if any of these things had happened in isolation it really wouldn't be a problem. The fact that so many issues arose within the first day is disappointing and the lack of common courtesy in returning a phone call today is the last straw. I truly hope the rest of our stay improves.

We were disappointed, however, that ""oceanfront"" did NOT mean that we had the ocean directly in front of us or could even sea it. Maybe we should have known since this seems to be the case with all of the resorts in the area, but oceanfront meant that we were close to the ocean, and could hear it, but were separated by a strip of jungle. Once accessed, the beach walk was lovely but probably not a good place for ocean swimming since there are no lifeguards on duty and that whole area has some risk of jelly fish and crocodiles. The resort has a lovely, meandering salt-water pool and many units open right on to it. The resort is perhaps one of the furthest from the town of Port Douglas than most, although in a pretty and quiet area. If one has a car, it would not be a problem since it is less than a 10 minute drive to town. But without a car, one has to rely on shuttle companies which charge $5 per person per car and pick up and drop off at various resorts. There are not many taxis in the area.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",8 June 2016,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ","Lovely villa, so-so location",https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or545-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

Open, modern, tropical. Check-in was efficient with what felt like a little bit of attitude. We had a ""swim out"" 3bd/2ba apartment that was well appointed, clean and tidy. As we arrived early evening, we decided to stay on property for dinner. Dinner service was somewhat amusing if not a little bit irritating. The restaurant was either out of, or had only one bottle of most of the wines listed on the menu. Even our waitress was frustrated. She went off in a huff and left the bartender to come to the table to sort out what wine was actually available. The food was better than what I would have expected. The morning of departure we went back to the restaurant for breakfast. A sad excuse for a buffet breakfast. The restaurant was busy with what appeared to be delegates from a conference. Apparently this was too much pressure for our waiter who barked at me for requesting poached eggs at a different time from the rest of the table. Overall a lovely looking property, it just needs a little polishing (mostly staff) for the level of $$ being asked of its guests.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",6 June 2016,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Feeling Torn,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or550-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

It was very private yet still very close to the main resort pool and dining areas. The staff were very accommodating and we appreciated the invitation to the 10 year anniversary celebration of the resort!  We opted for the morning breakfast buffet each day which offered a broad selection including eggs cooked to order and a pancake making machine which the kids enjoyed. The main resort pool was huge (bigger than Palm Cove Pullman) but the gym was small. Location great, a quick 3 minute drive to Port Douglas shops and 3 minute walk to the beach. We also stayed at the Pullman at Palm Cove and would rate Port Douglas higher and more 'exclusive.'

"1,915 reviews",73,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Jubesss,30,4.5,"We actually stayed in a private room within the sea temple complex for three nights.  It's a lovely place to stay and the two bedroom swim out apartment towards the back of the resort was an excellent choice for us during warm weather.  The rooms are fairly modern and well presented with everything you could need.  Having said that, the bathroom in our room was out dated and very small and you had to step up quite high to get into the bath/shower which seemed a bit odd for a apartment which was otherwise quite nice.  I doubt an elderly person or a child would be able to get in or out of the shower/bath without assistance. You can see into many of the rooms from the pool which surrounds all the buildings, and they all looked like they were furnished much the same regardless of whether they were private or resort rooms.  The rooms, and particularly the swim out rooms, aren't all that private given that people can swim past at any time night or day and this can also be annoying with kids screaming or playing in the pool area but wasn't a big problem for us.  The resort grounds are huge and it appears there's a private lockable garage for all guests which is good because you would probably have to hire a car as it takes about an hour or so to walk into town.  The gardens are a little in need of some work and looked a bit ratty and neglected.  The bar area near the pool also looks a bit old and shabby and in need of an upgrade yet the main hotel foyer and restaurant area are lovely and very inviting.  There is direct beach access which is great and you could go for a long walk up the beach to town which would be quicker than walking the road.  I would like to rate this resort higher because the rooms are overall quite nice and it has a lot going for it but I feel it really is in need of some upgrade and a bit of a makeover.  I have seen prices for resort rooms here and they seem a bit expensive for the quality provided.

"1,915 reviews",35,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Thomas C,40,4.5,"Recently spent 3 nights at the Pullman Resort Port Douglas in a three bedroom Villa with private pool. Arriving at the resort felt great looking at this amazing establishment with lush green gardens. Check in was great, friendly staff member Peter looked after us and made sure our Villa was ready as soon as possible as we were checking in early. The three bedroom Villa was amazing. Beautiful furnishing with large 4 person spa in main room. All bedrooms great size, and large dining table and living area downstairs. Great BBQ area with private pool really added to this stay. If I had to say anything negative it would be about the bird that kept waking me up on my first night but that's what you get when you are located on the coastline next to bushland. We had breakfast everyday at the Resort and there was a great selection of food. Unfortunately at times the staff lost our coffee or eggs order. This happened twice and noticed it happened to a few other people but the staff were friendly. Dinner at the resort was great. Staff fantastic at dinner!

We have wanted to stay here for quite sometime after a visit to their spa 6 years ago (I think we should have done so back then) I think for the Internet prices  it is a bit tired. We somehow received a great 3 night deal by ringing them direct and saved 50%. This made it pretty good value. Staff were pretty good, room is a bit tired, would've been great in its day! It's a clever set up with choice of pool access rooms or spa top rooms, we found it easy to walk to the pool bar from our room #243. Bar service was hit and miss, happy hour seems to decrease staff.... could be tactical waiting 15 mins for a beer taints the memory somewhat, extra staff to serve you at your table or sun lounge would be good 1 hr wait for snacks was a bit long. Lagoon Pool setup is fab its huge and you can swim around at your own leisure. Room service was ok, breaky was so so nothing to rave about. It is out of town but we had a hire car so not bothered and the town shuttles are cheap and easy to catch if you want to have a few drinks and dinner in town.

"1,915 reviews",28,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Winther76,30,4.5,"Stayed for 5 nights and can't say we were overly impressed. The rooms were clean however, there was a problem with insects in the room. Tiny little bugs that would appear everywhere. We were located in the outer facing rooms and when we sat outside our room, one of our seats faced next doors bedroom window. Awkward for them coming out of the shower and equally awkward for us! Walking around the complex, there were so many rooms. When you got to the pool area and stood near the bar, I couldn't help but notice how few sun beds they had. You had to get there early to get a sun bed, and when you did they weren't very comfortable at all. We ended up taking cushions from the table and chair sets. The sun beds were all so closely placed together, you felt you were sitting right on top of strangers. So many rooms in the complex and so little space set aside for sun baking - at a 5 star resort, it just doesn't make sense. Many rooms had their own pool access. We didn't so were in competition with the others. Service at the pool side was not great. One person behind the bar creating cocktails as guests lined up. I stood there waiting to pay for ice cream, and ended up putting them back as the wait was so long. This was coming into happy hour mind you. It was as though there wasn't enough staff around. The service at breakfast was also disappointing. We would sit and wait 5-10 mins before we decided to get the attention of the staff to order our eggs. First morning, no one took our order. We felt frustrated knowing we paid top dollar to stay here. We have stayed at 4 star resorts and have received a higher level of service. Really disappointing. We won't be back anytime soon.

The wifi is paid for, but i found out on the last day that if we signed up for some sort of membership it would be free.

Crispy white linen, everything spotless. Fully equipped kitchen and an expensive room service which we avoided. Mini bar was a couple of drinks and a chocolate bar or two. Overpriced as usual. These should be discontinued in my opinion. Fully equipped kitchen, with full size fridge. There is an amazing spiral staircase from your balcony up to the enormous rooftop entertainment area, spa pool and BBQ. We read a review saying that the pool was like a shallow warm bath, so glad we didn't bother. Our own pool is cool, so we didn't care. The bathroom was ok, but anyone shorter than me could not get in the shower over the bath without great difficulty, as it's ridiculously deep.

Our apartments were big and well appointed. All the staff we had contact with at the resort were fantastic and very friendly. Our only issue was that we booked our stay with Select Retreats in Melbourne and the owner, George, advised me in writing that our room configuration had three bedrooms and three en-suites, which it did not. So I wouldn't use them ever again. We found out we were booking privately owned apartments. This was very disappointing and we have since received a small refund and an apology for George misleading us but this had nothing to do with the Pullman.

If you do wish to stay in a Penthouse apartment, suggest you select one (most likely a 3 bedroom) that has it's own private pool & outdoor area.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",9 March 2016,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",SEA TEMPLE Resort Port Douglas,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or640-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",30,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Elizabeth P,40,4.5,"Spent two nights here for our anniversary. Check in was fairly easy, we arrived early and our room wasn't ready, the staff member who we first spoke with didn't seem to be very confidant in what she was doing/saying, this always fills me with dread! Nonetheless, we drove back into town and got a call not long after telling us the room was ready, when we got back, we were checked in by the assistant manager - he is great! We stayed in a studio spa room, which was lovely, but i would recommend booking a swim-out room, otherwise it doesn't feel like anything particularly special! The pool is great, just be prepared to see some cane toads swimming around in there if you swim after dark! A lovely bottle of sparkling was delivered to our room as an anniversary gift, this was a very classy touch - THANK YOU! Was disappointed to find the pool bar closed at 7.45pm on Saturday night, we popped down for a swim and a cocktail, but it wasn't to be! Dining at Aqua restaurant was up there with one of the worst dining experiences that i've had in some time. When we arrived at the restaurant the staff were running around like headless chooks (i think there was some training going on) we had a 7.00pm booking, arrived at 6.50 to be told our table wasn't ready, even though the restaurant was nearly empty....again had the feeling of dread given the attitude of the waitress who told us to wait and order a drink until our table is ready. I ordered a cocktail, and was told ""we dont have that anymore"" so didnt bother to select another one. I was SO disappointed with the menu, serving beef from VIC, and chicken Kiev...this is Far North QLD, we want your amazing seafood and local produce....I could have cried!!! The menu does not suit the environment or the climate of the area, hopefully they make some changes, because the setting itself is beautiful! Breakfast is below average at best, possibly the worst buffet i've been to at an Accor hotel. Ultimately, this is a fabulous resort, which is let down by some of the staff, and the on site dining! Special mention to the Assistant Manager who checked us in and out, he asked directly for our feedback, and could not have been more welcoming or professional (if only i could remember his name!)","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",1 March 2016,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Nice Resort...But could be so much better!,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or645-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

A big thank you to Geoff, who looked after us with a great deal as we were returning customers. February 2016 was disappointing. On arrival, spoke to Anthony(assistant manager), who was very abrupt and not very accomodating at all. Not a great start for a 9 day stay at the resort. Every year on arrival we would have a complimentary bottle of sparkly awaiting for us in our room. Not this year. The rooms are not cleaned to a standard of a 5 star resort as they claim they are. Bathrooms are growing mould in the showers. Not a very nice sight at all. The tiled flooring is black from dirt scum. They only get a cold water wipe over with the mop. You can not walk bare foot inside these apartments without shoes. I'm not having a go at the cleaners here. They can only work with what is given to them. In fact the cleaners were lovely and did their job to a standard that allows them with the cleaning supplies they are given. Management really needs to pull there socks up if they want to satisfy there customers. Furnishing in the apartments are in need of and upgrade or if they are trying to save money which it looks like give them a steam clean. We had to put sheets over the couches before we sat on them.  You shouldn't have to do that if you are claiming to be a 5 star resort. Where were the dressing gowns and slippers in the wardrobe that you claim to supply? The fridge was a joke. I had ice cream in there for days and it was all sloppy. Doesn't work properly. We had this problem in 2015 and they changed the fridge over.

We even had a situation where one of the housekeeping staff accidentally broke a drink of ours in the fridge when cleaning it and the staff went out to the bottleshop especially to replacement as it wasn't something that they stocked, now to is service!

"1,915 reviews",42,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,MR1961,50,4.5,"If you are looking for a five star resort set amongst gorgeous landscaped tropical palms and next to both an Australian Top 100 Links golf course, Palmer Reef,  and Port Douglas beach, then look no further. The front desk offers free shuttle service to and from the golf course. The enormous free form semi-circular pool is well-designed, with a 50 metre long wide main area good for lap swimming. The gym is very small, with one universal weight machine, two tread mills, one stationary bicycle, all facing the walls and away from the one wall-mounted TV. We enjoyed a two bedroom penthouse, which affords more privacy than ground floor, pool access rooms, and the self-serve efficiency of our own kitchen, complete with top of the range Bosch oven, microwave and dishwasher. The beds were very comfortable, and the rooms have block out roller blinds. Gourmet Dilmah teas, sugar and Nescafé coffee, plus long life milk, were supplied, and dish washing liquid sachets, laundry powder, but you will need all other condiments (salt, pepper, cling wrap, etc). Unlike the Pullman Palm Cove, bathrobes are not supplied here. We experienced a severe electrical thunderstorm and extreme humidity during our stay, and the Daikin airconditioning stopped. Anthony in maintenance came around within ten minutes and restarted the units. The gas bottle BBQ Weber also seemed sluggish, and maintenance promptly came and cleaned the jets. We dined one evening at Aqua. Some of the food flavour combinations were a little different - reef fish with an egg omelette, beef carpaccio with Japanese green seaweed - but the portions were fine, as was the service. A very relaxed and chilled out holiday.

"1,915 reviews",77,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,LOLP08,50,4.5,"We rented a 3 bedroom apartment with private plunge pool and were absolutely thrilled with the experience.  It was exactly what we were expecting and our group of five (2 couples and a single - long time friends who travel well together and have reasonably high expectations) really enjoyed our time here.  The apartment was well appointed with all the little luxuries you might expect at this level.  Bedrooms were all upstairs - the master suite was enormous (gigantic actually) with an equally large spa bath, private lounge area and loads of open space.  The other two bedrooms were spacious and shared a second bathroom.  Downstairs had a generous sized kitchen (even had a Nespresso coffee machine), separate dining and sunken lounge areas, a downstairs toilet and laundry with washer and dryer.  The entry foyer had large double wooden entry doors, a small moat and a giant water feature.  Outside had it's own lounge area with plenty of seating, undercover BBQ and outdoor dining table.  The pool is nice and private with water feature and sun lounges and has plenty of ledges for sitting and enjoying a drink, as well as a sun shade which covers part of the pool.  Overall it was a great place to stay with friends - we ate in and prepared all our meals with the exception of one lunch and one dinner, which we had at the resort's restaurant.  Everything we needed for our cooking / meals was there - no problem.  Access to Four Mile Beach is close by, well sign posted and easy to get to.  We took food and drinks to the beach for sunset drinks no problem at all - not far to carry everything at all.  Really enjoyed the experience and would most definitely stay there again.  The only strange thing we found was when using the washing machine and dryer, they were connected to the light switch, so when we turned the light off in the laundry, the machines turned off mid cycle which meant we had to start all over again.  Very weird arrangement and we twice forgot to leave the light on (trying to be environmentally friendly by switching things off when we weren't using them) and had to redo everything.  Other than that it was fantastic experience and to be honest, can't wait to stay there again.  Highly recommend it.  The rooms around the lagoon pool looked nice as well, but the ground level rooms all have swim outs and they were really quite noisy with all the excited children enjoying the lagoon pool.  Plus we could really hear the music from one of the rooms who had their speakers pointing into the pool.  At least with the private pools, you can also have quiet time - we still went and enjoyed the lagoon pool during the day - including the swim up bar - but escaped to our own private pool for afternoon / evening drinks and dinner.  Best of both worlds!","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",26 January 2016,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Fantastic Experience All Round,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or675-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

We arrived late on Christmas Eve after a long flight and long day.  We booked three studio spa rooms months ago, and requested adjoining rooms for us and our two kids.  Not only did the rooms not adjoin, they weren't even in the same building (they were in the next building over).  As a result, I asked about changing to a 3 bedroom villa (same price).  The front desk person told us it was available, but she could not make this change, so we had to wait for the manager.  He then told us the villa was not available and when I asked about a 2 bedroom villa, he said there was one available but it was not clean.  We stayed with the rooms we had.  The rooms are in need of some serious updating.  The shower stall was covered in mold and pretty disgusting.  The floors were dirty as we found out after walking around barefoot then putting our feet on the bed and seeing dirt all over the white bedspread.  After that, we made sure to wipe our feet thoroughly before getting into bed.  The white blanket I pulled from the closet was covered in brown and yellow stains.

The restaurant is great, the buffet breakfast is lovely good selection of food. Good easy to use high chairs for bubs. The pool is amazing very big. The location is only a 10 minute car ride to the centre of town and they have shuttle buses every half hour or so. Also IGA and chemist and animal farm 2 min drive away. The beach is lovely for walking and the resort backs onto it. The spa is huge and very luxurious and relaxing. The only negative is that the paving around the pool is getting due for an update and so are the deck chairs.

"1,915 reviews",86,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Sue C,20,4.5,"Stayed there recently with another family of 4. I booked 2 x 2 bed apartments at the same price. My friend's apartment only had 1 bathroom and and ours had 2 so make sure that your 2 bed apartment has 2 bathrooms when you book as it wasn't indicated anywhere that the rooms could have different configurations. The apartment itself was a good size one but wasn't terribly clean; the floor seriously needed a good scrub and there were stains everywhere although it was made out of tiles. We stayed for 7 days and the standard of daily cleaning was getting worse everyday; it felt like the longer we stayed, the lesser the cleaners felt like doing their job. My friend even saw the cleaners dumping everything on the floor first when they were changing the sheets so be aware that the bedding is thrown on the floor on a regular basis. There were heaps of dust under the couch and the beds. There was a surcharge over Christmas Eve and on Christmas which I thought was ridiculous because room service was not available on Christmas Day so there shouldn't have been any surcharge. The cut off time for Breakfast on Christmas was also earlier than usual but we didn't receive any notification about that. My friend and his family turned up later that day so there wasn't any food available; he then ordered an omelette from the kitchen and they turned up with egg benedict. When we asked them to replace it with an omelette, the staff refused and said it was too late because they were busy preparing Christmas lunch. They reluctantly replaced the egg but then asked us to move to the terrace as they needed to settle the tables for lunch because we were sitting right in the middle of the restaurant. There was another couple sitting there but don't know why they were not asked to move away. We really got pissed off with the restaurant staff as they could have set all the other tables first and let us finish our food without offending us. Btw, breakfast food was the same everyday and was pretty boring and not yummy at all. Avoid staying in this hotel unless you have money to waste.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",31 December 2015,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Don't understand what it's rated a 5 star,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or700-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",62,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Winder226,50,4.5,"My (very) positive review is mostly due to the accommodation we had (a double room penthouse apartment with a central view on the pool) and the service provided by the front desk, which was impeccable in every sense. The resort is very quiet, but a little far from Port Douglas and from the closest airport (Cairns - taxi to the resort on arrival was 195 dollars), which pushed us to rent a car at one point despite a quite efficient shuttle service to town. The apartment we had was spacious, with a comfortable living area, kitchen and a private terrace with jacuzzi and barbecue area on the roof. Air conditioning perfect. The pool is quite ""artistic"" surrounded by a well maintained vegetation that gives a great tropical touch to the experience. The only negative note I would point out is the wireless access to the internet which is at a cost ($66 per week - we were not charges as we signed up for the Accor complimentary membership) but does not work and we had to use our mobile connections every time. The in-house restaurant  has a limited but interesting menu, with a good wine list: you will not find the best labels, but definitely something to enjoy for the evening. One note: we felt the cost of the accommodation was very low vs the quality of what we had.

Stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment with swim out pool which proved extremely popular with the pre schooler and us! Although we had a room with a swim out, our room was still very private and we never felt overlooked. Room 174. The room was clean and we loved how we could self cater if we chose whilst still having the luxury of having our room freshened up daily. The resort restaurant's food was very good as was room service however food could prove costly should you choose to eat at the resort often as we did as the main part of town was a 5-10 min drive and we were worn out at the end of the days activities. Breakfast is also costly and more so when you have to pay an extra $4.50 for a real coffee even after paying $30 for a full breaky. Better off to keep breakfast essentials in the apartment after a stop off at Coles in town or try a cafe in town. Overall we had a fab time. Fantastically warm weather but cannot complain with air con and gorgeous pool. The only downside for me has nothing to do with the resort itself.

"1,915 reviews",371,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,DerekParsons,30,4.5,First the good points. Our room was spacious and clean. Everything is focused around the fantastic swimming pool which is claimed to be the largest in Australia. There is plenty of covered parking which means you don't have to get into a hot car. It is in a good location about 5km from the centre of Port Douglas and within a few minutes walk to the beach. Unfortunately the resort is let down by poor service and lack of staff. The poor service started about 15 minutes after we arrived in the restaurant (see my separate report) and continued until we left 5 days later. Every morning I had to go to reception about things that had not been done. We had a plastic water jug in our room which had a hairline crack in it and each time we filled it with water and left it in the fridge overnight we ended up with a large puddle.  It took them three days to replace it. It also took them four days to replenish the tea and coffee in our room. We had a penthouse apartment which was described as a golf view. You could not see the golf course from our room (see attached photo) - it just looked towards the golf course.  The other thing you can not see in the photo is the road that runs behind the trees. Most of the rooms are round the pool with many having direct access. If you want privacy I would suggest you do not choose one of these rooms as people can see in from the pool or as they walk past. Considering the amount of money it costs to stay here I would expect free wifi but unless you are an Accor member it is chargeable at about $12 per day or $66 for 7 days. It amazes me that I can go into a cafe and pay $4 for a cup of coffee and have unlimited wifi access. If it was't for the poor service I would have rated this hotel much higher.

Many of the persons in our group commented on the danger , unexpected by US guests due to our building codes . At least one other man fell ,many tripped. Although the conference staff was quite helpful , the professional drivers refused to transport us to a medical facility and staff initially suggested we hire a taxi and not tell the driver what happened . Conference staff though came through for us and provided transportation. The nearest medical facility is about 30 KM and a real hospital about 1 1/2 hours away. Management did not even bother to take an accident report and when the incident was mentioned on check out, the staff person said they too had almost fallen, so a known hazard ,  which they  have not addressed even after my communications over 6 weeks.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",8 November 2015,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",A dangerous Place with Fall Hazards,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or735-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

She didn't have another mattress protector cover, so she had to come back!

A full kitchen ,an indoor fountain , desk area, 8 seater dining table and 4 couches were brilliant. Every with all this there was still a feeling of space . A beautiful experience staying here. Breakfast in the aqua restaurant was delicious and was lovely to sit near the pool and contemplate the day ahead. A shuttle bus runs every half an hour into port Douglas shops at the cost of $9 return. You could walk along the beach into town but it is a 40-60 minute walk.

This is a great place to stay with (or without) your kids. It is a short drive into Port Douglas for restaurants or shopping, so a hire car is handy or you can get the free shuttle into town. As it is out of the town centre, it's lovely and quiet (except when the kids are in the pool) and only a short stroll to the beach.

The reason we return to this resort is it has a lovely (and only) outside lounge area that juts out over the pool, great for relaxing and especially nice in the evenings, but this time we are over it! This area was often closed off for functions often from 11am till late at night, often two functions at a time so there is nowhere else (other that reception couches) to relax in an evening, so your stuck in your room. One Wedding had the meal served in the reception area, can you believe it. It’s become a joke, on our last day the whole pool bar area and seats where closed off for the afternoon, where does one go, to the kiddies shallow area near the restaurant. The noise on the Saturday night from the guests went on till Midnight. It become a noisy crowed hotel with functions, its clear hotel guests are second best. No more quite meals anymore, the racket from the guests spoils all that. If you do go get a room at the far end of the hotel. Would find it hard to return, pity as really like the hotel.

All our guests thoroughly enjoyed their stay at the Pullman Sea Temple Resort Port Douglas. We had 7 days there and we found it an ideal location, to cater for the different age groups. Some wondered off to the beach, others enjoyed drinks by the main pool, or enjoyed day tours. The highlight for us was that In the evening we could get together in one of the 3 b/r villas, we would all bring something to share.

"1,915 reviews",152,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,BHP534,40,4.5,"This was a return visit having only stayed 1 night previously. Stayed for 3 nights this time. On arrival early evening there was no one on reception, after a while I went into the gift shop and the receptionist was in there. She was helping other people and wasn't too interested in me until I said I was checking in.  Like other guests have mentioned, it is a huge complex and finding your room, especially in the dark is not easy. We had a 2 room swim out apartment, which was very nice and of course have to say the pool is great.  Being Accor guests, subject to availability we can get a 5pm checkout. This we would have liked as our flight wasn't until 4pm.  However, initially they wouldn't budge from 11am as 90% of the complex was booked out for a conference and people were booked into our room at 12.30. I was a bit slow here, as I should have remembered check in isn't until 3pm. We tried at the desk regularly, but were told they wouldn't know until the night before (this was beginning to annoy us) and of course later we realised, how could they not have known about the convention. Finally, we were given midday and of course on departure there were no cleaners to be seen anywhere near our apartment or the numerous guests. Breakfast was good as was location of the dining area and the guy on the bar there in the evenings, whose name escapes me is a real asset to the place. Always a smile on his face, unlike some of the recption staff.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",8 September 2015,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Enjoyable Stay Overall,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or775-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

We were really looking forward to the warmer weather after our very cold winter so this was perfect. We enjoyed our time here despite a few initial glitches and would say that it met our expectations.   On arrival a bottle of sparkling wine and a welcome note were a lovely touch.    However, it must be said that it can be a little confusing locating your room and parking space in such a large resort if you don't know where it is, and this was not what we felt like dealing with after our travel, especially in the dark. The receptionist, while reasonably efficient, seemed a little offhand and was not especially clear with her instructions regarding car parking.  The other thing which was noticeable on arrival was the damp, musty smell in both the lift and the room when we first got there, but fortunately this was not quite as bad the next day.   I would say though that if you are sensitive to smells and chemicals this would not be the best place to stay - the smell of chlorine for the pool seemed to permeate everything.   We sneezed and sniffed quite a bit in our room....not sure if that was from the cleaning products or something else.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",6 September 2015,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",A relaxing break,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or775-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

I ended up going to the hotel lobby to do some work (which was not much better than the room) and was approached by other guests asking if the WiFi was better than in the room.  I will say, the staff at the hotel really made this place - Laura the assistant manager was fantastic - really helping to plan tours and dinners.

"1,915 reviews",32,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Corinne C,40,4.5,The Sea Temple is a great choice. We really enjoyed our stay here. We chose to stay in a studio spa room which suited us perfectly. You get more privacy while still being close to the pool. And we really enjoyed the spa in our room. I noticed that the swim out rooms on the ground floor had an aspect of convenience as the pool area is small and it can be hard to find chairs and it does get crowded. Having a room that opens up directly to the resort pool would provide more personal space and comfort but also less privacy as pool users could be directly outside your room. If you enjoy spending time in or around the pool then this may be a good option. The rooms are modern and spacious and well kept. Beds are very comfortable. House keeping is efficient. Hotel location was great for - 5 min drive from town centre (would recommend hiring car in port douglas).

"1,915 reviews",7,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,GrantW1969,50,4.5,We recently spent a week staying at the Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple with two teenagers and found the property to be very impressive. We spent seven nights in one of the villas with its own plunge pool but found ourselves spending most of the time in the large lagoon pool and enjoying the resort facilities. I note that most of the negative comments made recently relate to poor wi-fi and/or expensive wi-fi and I think that highlights that people could find nothing else to complain about and reflects the quality of the rest of the facilities on offer. The Resort is positioned immediately adjacent to the beach but it's obviously a lot further away from the main shopping/restaurant area of Port Douglas than a number of other properties and walking into town is not realistic. Shuttle services are available and if you have a rental car it's only a couple of minutes drive. I actually think it's a positive to be further away from the main shopping area. The Resort has some wonderful staff throughout the bars and restaurants and we also had several conversations with the very friendly General Manager Elizabeth who is very hands on and attentive to the needs of guests and the quality of the operation. I should also highlight the wonderful Vie Spa. My wife and I had a massage during our stay and the spa staff were also incredibly professional and an absolute delight to deal with.

Although the plunge pool was not useful for us ... not interesting to teenage kids and too cold to be compelling ... the main hotel pool was delightful.  We were busy during the day, and regret only having had one opportunity to go for a long swim, which we did after dark.  The whole family loved exploring the extensive pool and then enjoying the spa.  We wish we had one more day there.  We had one dinner at the hotel restaurant, which was very good, and were able to get a latte in the morning before our early snorkel.

We have stayed here before children and now we stay with our 3 young children and we love it. The rooms are large, luxurious and very comfortable. You could cater your whole stay as the kitchens are amazing or just use it for breakfasts and lunch's and snacks. The room we stayed in the time was an interconnecting 2 bedroom apartment with a studio so there was more than ample room for the 5 of us. The apartment was also a penthouse so we had the rooftop spa and bbq which we loved for doing easy kids dinners a couple of nights. And yummy BBQ feasts for mum and dad. The pool is a real feature of the hotel the size of it and the lagoon style let's there be enough room for everyone no matter how busy it is. The resort is a little bit out of town but that never has bothered us as the kids love getting the Port Douglas shuttle into town. If you are staying a few days it is worthwhile getting a pass for the shuttle (they come approx. every 20 mins) so you are never waiting that long.

We were seated outside right beside an area where a wedding was taking place on the other side of a curtain. The music from the band was loud enough that it was difficult to talk and hear over. Asked the waitress if we could move to one of the 10 nearby vacant tables that were further away from the loud speaker only to have the manager (a guy about 45, tattoos on his arms) arrive and say he could take us to a table inside. Being a lovely night we opted to stay outside - our mistake as the music got louder. At the end of the meal I asked the manager why we couldn't have been moved to one of the 10 tables that remained vacant for our entire meal. He said ""I offered you a table inside"". When I said ""yeah, but what about all these vacant ones here"" he simply took my credit card and refused to say anything further. Thankfully the food was quite reasonable.

The personal rooftop was absolutely devine! we dined one night in the restaurant and were highly impressed! Upon knowing it was our honeymoon we were given a table overlooking the pool. The food was just as amazing as the location and atmosphere.

The bed linens were fresh but our bed was two singles make up together. The bathroom was huge with a double spa bath, separate shower, separate toilet and twin basins. Papers are delivered to your door if you wish each morning. Car parking was a bit of a hassle as it was Easter and very busy but we always found  a spot eventually. The resort itself is huge. We were very glad we were not in the rooms around the pools edge as it was noisy with kids and parents. Very nice to have a drink at the bar and look out over the pool. You can walk straight out onto the beach there and enjoy the peace and quiet. We celebrated our wedding anniversary here and had a lovely dinner at Aqua. I booked a table by the pool when booking the room so we had a beautiful night there. The food was perfect as was the service including some champagne to celebrate from the hotel. The staff here are all trying to look after you. We didn't like the thought of a buffet breakfast so ate out each morning. My only complaint was the wifi - absolutely useless. I even tried to use the hotel computer in the lobby but couldn't get through on that. All I wanted to do was check on for our flight home. You can get some free wifi but then you have to pay and at this level of resort one would expect it to be free and available in your room. It is a few minutes drive out of town but if you have a car it's not a problem. There is also a shuttle bus but there is a charge for that also. The spa was also booked out when we got there which was a shame but we were able to get a massage at another resort (at a much more reasonable charge as well).

"1,915 reviews",181,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,TOPCAT05,40,4.5,"A beautiful hotel but with a few faults. Check in took ages with only one person on the desk ( so much for express check in for Club Accor members). We finally got checked in and found our room (2 Brm apartment with private plunge). The apartment was a great size and was really well appointed. The decor and condition of the apartment was a little dated and had obviously seen better days, but still a great apartment all the same. It was great having our own private pool right on our door step and of course private. The pool itself needs a little work with all  mould and calcium build up, but that could be easily fixed. The apartment is serviced daily and the team that do this are an absolute delight. The main pool is just stunning and the main feature of the resort. A great place for an early evening cocktail. The big thing that let's this resort down is the restaurant. Being a Sunday we decided to do the Buffet dinner. What a giant let down. The only thing that wasn't bland and tasteless on that buffet were the prawns. The desserts looked and tasted like Sara Lee frozen desserts. The restaurant staff were friendly and gave great service but all of that is useless when your serving mediocre food. The next morning we did the breakfast buffet and we were again incredibly disappointed. Soggy hash browns, soggy waffles, a very small selection of fresh fruit. Come on this is Far North Queensland where is the fresh local fruit? The chef's really let down this resort. There are amazing cafes and restaurants in town but when you stay at a resort like the Sea Temple. I expect amazing food. I would have liked to have tried the day spa but this was booked out every day of our stay (Sunday - Wednesday) and it wasn't even peak season. I actually had to go to another resort for my spa treatments. It is a great hotel and I would stay here again but please fix up the restaurant situation and put more staff on in the spa.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",10 April 2015,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Great Resort,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or905-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",729,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,CarolinaBecky,40,4.5,"The setting, accommodations and decor of this resort are outstandingly beautiful and luxurious.  Pools wind by many of the rooms and the lush tropical landscaping and lobby open to the pool, which is torchlit at night, make this seem like paradise.  Our room had its own plunge pool, an elegantly appointed bathroom, a full kitchen with microwave, full size refrigerator, range, dishes and dining table as well as laundry with soaps supplied.  The decor of the room was modern and calming as was the patio that overlooked the fenced in plunge pool.  However, the room's housekeepers needed training as the countertops in the bathroom were dusty as were a few other surfaces.  The tile floors were not cleaned. The restaurant was beautiful.   The front desk reception staff were quite friendly and helpful.  But the restaurant staff were not.   The signs said you could get eggs cooked to order at breakfast; you could, if only you could chase down a staff person to ask.  One morning I asked the one person I saw in the dining room; she said someone would come to my table to take my order and then disappeared; no one else appeared.  The second day I simply "" tackled"" the person I saw to make my request; she was surly.  Bar service was very slow too.  The food in the restaurant for dinner was delicious.  This would be a five star place if they would just train their service and housekeeping staff, especially on the details of excellent service.  Given the staff, I would have to say I think this was not good value for price charged.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",11 March 2015,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ","Beautiful room, beautiful setting, surly breakfast service--mixed review",https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or930-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",48,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,ahyden,30,4.5,"The 'feels like' temperature for our visit was 109 degrees and our A/C was not functioning properly.  We spent two miserable nights sweating instead of sleeping.  The hotel sent a 'repairman'  twice that changed filters and actually told us that we were imagining that it was hot! What!??  We were with a large company group and if it were not for them taking charge of this, I don't know what we would have done. The A/C unit on the terrace rooftop was adjusted and then we spent the remaining 4 days in comfort. We needed to call friends in others rooms many times, but the direct dial from our room did not work. We had to dial the operator each time and told them, but they brushed us off and assumed that we just did not know how to pick up the phone and type in room number, instead of checking into it. It was this attitude that unfortunately permeated our stay there...  The pancake machine for breakfast only sort of worked for one of the 6 days we were there. The juices on the buffet were always full of dead gnats and I had to ask daily for the water carafes to be replenished.  It was also quite a wait for food to be replenished on the buffet. As final insult, we wanted out boarding passes printed and were instructed to email them to a rather odd address. Went to pick them up and they could not be found.  Apparently it was a staff members email address and he had gone home for the day. Had to resend to another odd email....  What a strange policy - right? And again with the poor attitude... no, ""We are sorry for your inconvenience' just more of feeling like we the guests were the inconvenience to them...   NOT at all the care and service of what we have experienced at nice hotels around the world.

Lovely easy check in, we were delayed a few moments as we arrived just after a group, the receptionist was very apologetic and gave us vouchers for the bar which wasn't necessary as we hardly noticed the delay.  Room was lovely, very clean, and decorated in a contemporary style, lovely big bathroom and huge jacuzzi bath.  I would recommend hiring a car if you are staying here, it is a good 10 minute drive to the main part of town, there is a shuttle bus which is $10 per go, but we were very glad we had hired a car as we popped in to town many times as it was too hot to sit around the pool for very long.  The pools are lovely and have a very relaxing feel around them, with tap water freely available to guests.  We didn't eat at the hotel so can't comment on the food but it did look very nice.  The only down side was the extortionate price of WiFi, you could get 30 minutes free per day but you had to sit in reception.

We had to ask the front desk for someone to come to our room for new towels and to clean our room, as it was late in the afternoon and no one had been there yet.  Additionally, we also had to call down and ask for room service to come up and pick up our dirty trays. The bed was comfortable and the temperature of the room was never an issue.

Initially we booked a swim out room privately through an agent but on arrival we discovered the AC had broken. We went and saw Jen at reception and she arranged for an alternative swim out room for us. She was extremely helpful, polite and a pleasure to deal with. Our room was wonderful - we were in swim out 174, which is located within the lagoon, not far from the main pool or pool bar. The room was serviced every day, clean towels were bought, dishes were done and rubbish collected. The linen was also changed. I felt the room was modern and clean, and it made for a wonderful, relaxing trip. The resort is beautiful, the environment nothing but relaxing and the staff I dealt with were all extremely helpful. It is a short drive or trip on the shuttle bus (which comes to reception regularly) to get into town, but it isn't much of an inconvenience and is a small price to pay to be located at the beautiful Sea Temple setting.

"1,915 reviews",53,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,MMPPJLK,40,4.5,"Cairns and the Great Barrier Reef were planned for the middle of our 3 week trip in Australia,and the Pullman Port Douglas was the perfect fit. A two bedroom, penthouse apartment with a fully equipped kitchen, dining room. living room, washer/dryer, with multiple outdoor spaces overlooking the resort's grande pool and lagoon. Our private rooftop terrace was enormous with its own Jacuzzi, BBQ, sink, sun beds, and dining table. Breakfast was included in the package we booked which was delicious and plentiful. The majority of the time we prepared our own meals, grilling ever night and dining alfresco. We also had a $100. food credit, and the seafood meal we had in the hotel's restaurant was excellent. Four Mile Beach is just a short walk from the property and is magnificent. Booking a trip to the Great Barrier Reef was easy and the port is only a 10 minute drive from the hotel. The staff was generally very helpful and friendly, and tried to accommodate our requests. At check in we were given free internet access which worked quite well throughout our apartment. However, the reception person scared us about stingers to the point we almost didn't go in the water. It seems there is quite a range of opinions on how safe the netted areas at the beaches and/or wearing  Lycra suits to snorkel/dive on the reef really are. In the end, they were both fine but be aware that swimming at the beaches is only allowed in netted areas this time of year, and the nearest one to the hotel is at the other end of Four Mile Beach. I didn't mind since it was nice to cool off with a swim after a run on the beach. The hotel also needs some updating and better maintenance. Our sun bed cushions were covered with mold. The ones that the hotel replaced them with were not much better. It took three attempts to sorta fix the dishwasher. It is really important which accommodation you choose, since on the first floor the outdoor space is quite limited but you can walk from your patio into the lagoon. If you are close to the reception, privacy is much less but it is a much shorter walk to the restaurant and shuttle. I highly recommend renting a car, since the area is very exotic and beautiful, and the wildlife habitat is very close to the hotel.  Going on to Sydney, tanned, rested, after a break from restaurant food with all clean clothes was a huge bonus.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",27 December 2014,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Perfect Accommodations between Luxury Hotels,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or980-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

The room itself was a spa-suite adjacent to the lagoon and was of a very high standard with its furniture and facilities.  A secluded access to the central pool area was very well conceived as it gave the impression of being personal and private.

The room doors close very loudly and neighbouring doors can be heard. This didn't bother us too much though. Upon entering the room on our first day it looked so lovely with a candle burning on the kitchen bench but our 3 yr old son ran straight up to it and dipped his fingers into the melted wax. Of course it is up to us to supervise our kids at all times and I appreciate the ambiance that candles give but it might be worth considering not having a burning candle in rooms where kids will be staying.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",10 September 2014,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",A relaxing stay in beautiful surrounds- shame the pool isn't warmer!,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1050-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",9,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,beachgirlChicago,30,4.5,"Just stayed at the resort for 4 nights.  We were upgraded to a rooftop room which was fabulous but we felt that they were compensating for the lack of any view at all from our room.  We booked 9 months in advance so I thought we would have a good choice. The rooms and amenities are great except maybe the shower which has a high tub in which to walk over.  This could definitely be a problem for elderly people.  The kitchen was well equipped. The beach is I guess what we expected but do not expect to use it. It is a nice walk to town from there though. There is one fancy restaurant which we chose not to eat at.  Fast food is not aloud in Port Douglas so everything is expensive and pricey. If the hotel really wants to get folks to eat there they need to make it more expense friendly and broaden their menu.  For the price and what they offered it was better to go to town and search or walk down the road to The Beach Shack for great Italian fare and great ambiance.  The pool bar was also ridiculous.  We only bought 2 bloody Mary's there that actually tasted awful and cost us $37. They did not even have a garnish.  I will give a shout out to the people working the desk who were very helpful with directions and excursions.  Especially the guy from North Carolina.  My biggest and final complaint which they blamed on the climate and I do not buy it as I have stayed all over the carribean and have never experienced this before, was cockroaches.  Once I knew they were there I was creeped out completely.  They were under the kitchen sink and when I walked into the living room one morning, there was a large one running across the sofa.

We were staying 40mins away up in Daintree before 4 nights at the Pullman but were heading out scuba diving on the reef on our changeover day. We needed towels for the trip and we were given them the day before we checked in without question or quibble by David on reception. The pool room was spacious and well maintained, with the added advantage that it had a washer and dryer. When you are away travelling for a month this is a real bonus. However a few days after we left we thought we had left some laundry in the machine. I called the Pullman and with luck David took our call and went to great trouble to try and find our clothes. Two days later we realised we had the ""missing"" items. Although embarrassed I called them back, as I am sure David would have still been looking. That was the level of service we had. The gym was small but of good quality, the breakfasts great - my 11 year old son particularly liked the pancake making machine. We played golf at the neighbouring course which was great - clubs, shoes all for rent, and you can just play 9 holes if you want. It is close to the beach but out of town but the bus was easy and regular.

The only downfall was the pool was really really cold - we didn't get to swim at all (weather was 26 to 28 for the 5 days we were there) and all other guests were complaining as well (very few people were actually able to bear the coldness for a swim) - the sea was warmer than the pool at Sea Temple - such a shame as we always come up to Port this time of year and this was the first time we have stayed at the Sea Temple but unfortunately due to the water been so cold we will go and stay at Peppers Beach Club (where we have stayed in the past) as the pool is alot warmer so is swimmable and comfortable this time of year - We are going to try and come back to Sea Temple in the months between November & January as we think that would be the only months the water would be bearable to swim in - It may be an idea that Sea Temple think about solar heating the pool as all the guests we spoke to said they wouldn't be returning there this time of year (up to November) which is a shame as apart from the huge disappointment of not been able to swim in such a beautiful huge pool everything else was perfect :-) - Also even tho the Sea Temple is out of town we had no problems in getting the bus in and out of town (we got a 4/5 day pass for $ 25.00 each) - the bus comes past every 1/2 hour and the drivers were fantastic they dropped us off wherever we wanted to go in town and also gave us their mobile numbers for when we wanted to be picked up - such a wonderful service no issues at all - they also run up to 3am (not that we were out that late lol) so was nice to be able to go out for dinner and get picked up and be able to have a few drinks without the hassle of having to have a designated driver","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",25 August 2014,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ","Pullman Sea Temple, Port Douglas",https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1075-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

Solar heating over the winter months would have been great and made our experience even better.  The restaurant is lovely and our food was beautiful on the 2 nights we ate there could not fault it.

Overall we enjoyed our stay, and came away refreshed and relaxed.

I am a travel agent and have worked at 5 & 6 star properties around Australia and the rest of the world. We booked a deluxe king room with spa. It was horribly positioned and we overlooked a footpath and the gym entrance. I rang up reception on checking in and let them know we were not happy with the room. She told me that those particular rooms are usually for 1 night stays (which we were not) and although they are described as garden view rooms....they are not. Plus they were too busy to be able to move us. Our balcony got no sun at all and no privacy in the room. We had to close EVERY blind in the room just to be able to change. From there it was just downhill. They have this beautiful big spa bath in the room, but no bath salts (even the Pullman at Cairns has bath amenities). The bath towels were old and thredding. We asked if we could borrow a DVD player but they said our room type does not come with one and they didnt even try to source one for us. Housekeeping woke us up at 9am for servicing which we turned away. We we spoke to the Front desk once we were out of the room requesting service as we would be out for the next 3 hrs....we came back and hadnt been done and had to call the desk again.

We were accomodated in an amazing 2 bedroom swim out apartment. This was great because we had access to kitchen and living facilities. The pool at this hotel is very new and spacious with room for many people to swim. There was a bar at the pool which served delicious food. The negatives of this Resort where as follows. We thought that our swim out meant that we would have sun all day on our lounges but as it turns out we were wrong. Our particular swim out only got sun for about 30 minutes from 10-10.30. Next time- we would request one of the other swim outs  in the center of the pool as they got sun the whole day. Despite the fact that the food from the pool bar was good it was very slow and took atleast 40 minutes to come which was disappointing. This resort had a gym but for the size of the grounds it was very small with only 6 pieces of equipment and a small stretching area. Obviously, this resort is not in the town and the drive to the town center is an approximately 25 minute round trip. We would normally stay at Peppers Beach Club which is just a walk to the beach + town but the pool and grounds are not as big.

The pool is lovely and if you are lucky enough to have a view of the pool then I'm sure you would feel differently.  Our room was very dark, even the bathroom did not have enough light to apply make-up. There is no exhaust fan in the bathroom so it very quickly became a sauna. The damp, musty smell this caused in the room had been unsuccessfully attempted to cover up with a candle oil burner in the bathroom, which only made the situation worse.

We had a penthouse apartment that had two bedrooms one bathroom a well equipped kitchen with bosch appliances and a euro laundry. Furniture was of a very good quality and far more comfortable than other places we have stayed.  The balcony was a highlight and so well protected that on days when it rained we were happy to lounge on the day bed and enjoy the sounds of the rain on the pool. At night the ambiance went up a notch with the flames lit all around the pool. A private circular staircase went from the balcony to roof terrace which was just huge. There were then two separate gazebo structures for your private use. One with a jacuzzi and one with bbq, sink and large comfortable outdoor setting for 6. In the massive open area there were 2 sun loungers with very comfortable seat cushions. The entire area was very private and did not feel overlooked.  We were reluctant to leave the resort so we picked up takeaway coffees from the restaurant each morning and longed by the beautiful pool or escaped to our roof terrace.

"1,915 reviews",79,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Amanda J,40,4.5,"Very impressed with our two bedroom apartment style room. Spa and BBQ on the rooftop and great decor, layout etc inside. That was really the only part of the Pullman we enjoyed.... Firstly, there is a children's pool with NO children in it because they were all running and screaming through the main pool. Not exactly relaxing and for the amount of money spent to stay here a little R&R would have been nice.... Secondly, at most 5 star resorts, the pool lunch/snacks/drinks menu is admirable... not the case here. One very bored looking girl manning a canteen in the middle of the pool who can ""re-heat you a sandwich if you want"" and pour you a slushy margarita out of one of those tacky cocktail machines you see in cheap pubs. No staff around the pool offering food or drinks or anything as usually experienced in other resorts. The gym was poor. One afternoon we endured hours of concrete cutting outside our room which smothered our room with fumes of petrol. Our neighbours constantly ordered room service and dumped their tray outside our door, attracting flies, and the trays were left sitting there for hours - one day I rang reception three times in the space of 6 hours to come and get it collected and it was finally collected at 8.30pm after I first called at 2.30. The real let down for us was the service and staff at the restaurant. The girls working there seemed inexperienced, uninterested and rather unprofessional. My husband ordered a Mai Tai and 15 mins later the waitress told us she couldn't make one because she didn't have any Amaretto (there is no amaretto in a Mai Tai) - we also ordered a brandy one night and not one of the staff knew what Brandy was. Every time we had a drink or a snack at the restaurant we felt unwelcome and would much rather spend our money at one of the fine dining restaurants in town. On a positive note, Anthony (the Assistant Manager) was an absolute professional and is a credit to this hotel. As much as we loved our room, I am not sure if we would stay here again mainly due to the hoards of screaming children around the pool and the ghastly service at the restaurant.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",17 May 2014,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Pros and Cons...,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1140-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",4,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Larna G,40,4.5,"We stayed at the Pullman Sea Temple for 10 nights from May 5th 2014. Our overall experience staying at this hotel was great, it is indeed as other reviews say an excellent choice for families. The day spa at the resort was lovely, as were the staff performing treatments. They were very welcoming and experienced, in all I visited the day spa 4 times during our stay it was a must! Check in was speedy and help offered to get to the room. We chose the 3 bedroom beachfront pool villa as we had our 20 month old with us and thought our own plunge pool would be a nice touch. There are 2 main reasons I wrote this review(have never written a review); Upon entering our villa, the first thing we noticed was something that should have absolutely been mentioned to us before we booked considering we had booked a cot-families with young children should beware-the 3 bedroom pool villas have a water feature on the left as you enter the villa. This is NOT blocked off at all and is a 2 foot drop and 30cm deep with water. We were quite horrified that this was not fenced/glassed but we took it upon ourselves to use chairs and a lounge to block it off. We spoke to reception about the issue and they did in fact 'drain' the pond. So if you have young children you should absolutely ask for this to be drained. The other extremely dangerous thing (more so than the pond) are the upstairs Master bedroom sliding windows. Downstairs all windows have locks top and bottom, they are simple little sliding locks that you can easily flick up or down there is no resistance. In the master there are no locks on the top, to my absolute horror my son flicked the bottom lock up and slid the window open as i sat on the bed. I raced over and grabbed him as he was headed straight out the window. It is a sheer drop from the second floor to the ground, there is a ledge halfway down but obviously a toddler would not make use of this. There is a guard rail that goes across the window but is in no way blocking a child from climbing straight out. I think due to the fact we were staying 10 nights and this happened around half way through, my child probably noticed little details watching us unlocking windows etc and he may not have noticed had we only stayed 3 or 4 nights. I made a point of letting the assistant manager know on check out and he said they would look into it so i am certainly hoping they do. We would choose a 2 bedroom ground floor room next visit purely to avoid the windows upstairs not being secure for children and the water feature. The only other negative comment i have was the food. We had joined advantage plus to make full use of the 50% off dining at the restaurant but were sadly disappointed as the food was only ""just"". We tried breakfast/lunch/dinner on several occasions and different days and tried ordering different meals but were forced to eat 90% of our meals in town. We are not by any means fussy eaters either. On a lighter note, the overall experience was certainly great. Staff are friendly, helpful and resort is truly lovely-as is in photos. We will certainly return however will be choosing a different room next time and will eat in town unless there is an overhaul in the food department! Perfect resort for families, there is a shuttle into town which is only about 6-7 minutes away but hiring a car makes it so much easier!","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",17 May 2014,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Great overall experience-3 Bedroom Pool Villa,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1145-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

Having stayed in Port Douglas before I was happy to be away from the centre of town and having a car made it nice and easy to pop up the road. If you don't have a car there's a shuttle bus that runs quite frequently throughout the day for $5. Our room was a swim-up 2 bedroom, it was great. Direct access to the pool from your room with private lounge chairs is fantastic. The rooms are modern and have all the things anyone could need including a spa bath, full size kitchen and dining area. The main bathroom had a spa bath and duel sinks! Very nice!  The resort itself is large and has a mix of privately owned and hotel managed rooms. The main part of the resort is centred around a huge pool that snakes it's way under bridges to a central bar area. The water temp was a little cool for me but during the warmer months would be perfect. The on site restaurant is typical of this style of resort with a main meal setting you back around $35, breakfast isn't cheap at $32 a head. All up the Pullman is an excellent resort and great place to relax.

The pool, grounds and room were beautiful and meticulously maintained. We had an issue with our hot water on the last morning but the maintenance team were there within five minutes of calling up and soon had it fixed. The food in the restaurant at breakfast, lunch and dinner were all of exceptional quality and really make you feel you don't need to venture outside the resort if you don't want to. The staff were very friendly, especially the guys at the pool bar. The hotel put on a lot of family activities over the Easter break, and whilst we don't have children it was clear to see it was a real family friendly resort which attracts well behaved children and parents who know how to be parents. We didn't feel the quantity of children was an issue for a couple having a weekend away as the pool in particular is big enough and cleverly designed to provide quiet areas if that's what you are looking for.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",24 April 2014,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Amazing again,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1155-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

This is not a beach destination although it is on the beach.  It is a walk through the woods to the beach.  There are no chairs at the beach and we could not get in the water due to the stingers.  The breakfast was very good and service was great.  I did feel like our room was not cleaned very well and our floors were not mopped daily.   The floors were sandy.  I am not sure how often the sheets were changed either.  To get to the breakfast or lobby you had to walk through the parking lot which I thought was weird.

I would stay here again, it was nice but a few things could be improved upon.  One day, the bar at the pool never even opened.

"1,915 reviews",23,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,AnneBendigo,40,4.5,"We recently spent some time at the Pullman Sea Temple Resorts at Palm Cove and Port Douglas.  My father had recently died and we needed somewhere quiet to rest and recover a little.  We booked a studio room at Port Douglas and it proved to be less than quiet.  It was tucked away on the ground floor with no view other than another apartment's wall and a couple of plants.  The side windows looked out onto a series of linen storage garages where staff came and went. The scraping noise (from upstair apartment's furniture) and the slamming of doors in the wing our room was in was quite frustrating at times.  This property has garages/car parking areas at every block of room/apartments.  Sounds convenient but actually means there is traffic moving around and I felt it detracted from the peaceful/relaxed environment that could be here.There was a large American conference in progress during our visit and this event dominated lobby and surrounding communal areas.  The loud music at one of their dinner's was quite obtrusive in the restaurant where we dined.  However the surrounds are stunning and the huge pool is quite amazing.  Many rooms did have direct access to the pool (many don't too).  The restaurant (and it's menu) is quite outstanding.  The staff were amazingly attentive, caring and polite and the food was fabulous.  The fruit platter (room service and lunch menu only) was great.  Be very careful taking the walking path to the beach (we were literally attacked by hoards of mosquitoes) - whilst this is outside the hotel's domain it is something to be careful of if venturing out.  The room itself was a mixed bag.  The bathroom was huge with a beautiful spa bath.  However the bedroom area was quite small with no comfortable chair/lounge to relax on.  The bed and pillows were very comfortable.  The small freezer compartment in the bar fridge had a broken door which meant that our food/drink items in the fridge froze and were therefore damaged.  There was no bathroom string line on which to dry bathers or small items.  This property is a bit too far from shops for walking.  Our stay at this property was a bit of a mixed bag for us but I would certainly be prepared to try again.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",6 March 2014,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ","Beautiful surrounds but location of rooms can be ""hit and miss""and not always quiet.",https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1180-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

We were originally booked into a one bedroom penthouse apartment with a spa on the roof however we needed to chage the dates for our travel and there were no available rooms of this type so we were upgraded to a 2 bedroom apartment with a private plunge pool. I was very happy with the room itself, we only had access to one of the bedrooms but that was fine The only downside was that the shower was over the bath and the bath was quite deep making it a bit of an athletic activity to get into have a bath or a shower. Also the exhaust fan in the bathroom did not work so we were fogging up the mirror every time we used the bath/shower.

We had a 2 bedroom swim up apartment which was spacious and tastefully decorated. The pool itself is amazing and we spent hours and hours floating around and swimming in it. The food at the resort is good, but not great and in the case of some of the dishes we tried we thought the chef was trying too hard to be foodie without quite nailing it. My only complaint is that the daily servicing wasn't up to scratch. One day the shower wasn't cleaned, the next the basins and the rooms were serviced quite late also. The beach close by but you can't swim anywhere up there this time of the year because of stingers.

The restaurant where they have toad racing - not a great idea for food!  If you are going to GBR, Port Douglas is a great choice and the Pullman is also a great choice.

"1,915 reviews",2,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Patricia B,30,4.5,"While this resort is beautiful there were several things that were less than acceptable.  When we checked in we were told that our room was not ready as they were still cleaning.  When we  were given access to our room after being cleaned there were several wet, dirty pool towels on our patio.  These towels remained there for three days even though I had let the front desk know that they were there.  While we were there for 5 nights the WiFi did not work at all.  This is unacceptable for a resort of this caliber.  We were told daily that it would be up and running but this never did happen.  Each day is was a different excuse.  During our stay of December 26 through December 31 the resort was terribly understaffed and it took 10 to 15 minutes to get a drink poolside.  There was only one bartender most of the day and he/she was running like crazy.  In the morning there was only one barista and getting coffee took another 10 minutes or so.  The barista was working the bar as well as the restaurant for breakfast.  When the resort is booked they should staff accordingly.  The work out room is extremely small for a resort of this size.  There is not enough cardio equipment and the floor space is very tight.  Almost impossible to get in a good work out.  Each morning there was a wait for equipment and I saw a lot of people give up.  Most guests have tours booked for the day and getting into the gym first thing in the morning is a must.    When we had to check out on the last day the front desk let us leave our luggage in storage until we had to leave for the airport.  We had to leave at 1:30 so stayed poolside for lunch.  The poolside BBQ was to open at 12:00 but this is when they began setting up for the lunch. The gentleman working the BBQ was frazzled and stated that this what you get when you take a day off and they don't prep for the next day. You could not get anything to eat poolside until well after 1:00.  This was unacceptable as we needed to eat and clean up prior to 1:30.   We were going to clean up in the wash room off of the lobby.  When we went to clean up the clothes that I had put in storage were missing.   They searched the storage room and to no avail it was never found.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",14 January 2014,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",A few concerns.....,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1205-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

Upon speaking to the service desk about this I was told that if I was not happy that I didn't have to stay there I could simply find somewhere else to stay. Fantastic to get off a plane after a long flight. I told him that YES we did have to stay there and I was not happy about being told that as I had just flown alllll the way their with my family in tow.

The units appear to all be residential condo/apartments and are very nicely appointed. This is a high end resort in its prime. The pool is actually a huge artificial salt water lagoon with a walk-up tiki bar and a meandering ""river"" that courses around the property.  All along the ""river"" the adjoining units have walk-out access to the water, which you can walk around (only knee-deep) to get to the main pool area and bar.  The restaurant is very good, and the breakfast buffet is pretty good (standard fare for Accor-managed hotels, but fresh and with friendly attentive staff). Our apartment, like most second floor units, had a rooftop jacuzzi and a gas BBQ, which perplexed us at first.

"1,915 reviews",14,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Swaties,10,4.5,"first of all the pool of this hotel is just over hyped.. it's nothing great just a simple pool... had two very disappointing experiences 1) Got bikini wax done at the spa. She had no idea how to do it... did a pathetic job.. plucked still could not tidy it... even did not clean the wax left and stuck to my hair... not only that i continuously told her the wax is too hot.. tht too in that sensitive area but she said it won't work if it's colder thn that... (i get it waxed on regular basis and nobody uses this hot wax) result was hair did not come out as she could not mentain the temperature.. pulled when it was not even settled coz obviously it was too hot to settle in seconds.. ) that time skin was red thinking it's jst redness due to irritated skin I ignored , now when i am back I noticed she burned my skin and i have burn marks... Please if you have no idea how to wax remove it from the services. 2) another pathetic exp was these guys are super liers.. I asked the reception guy to book a shuttle airport transfer for us from PD to Cairns. he quoted $35 for a person and confirmed the booking. next day in the morning i called the reception to confirm the pick up time.. the receptionist said she will confirm and give me a call back.. Gave me a call back after 10 min and confirmed the pickup time as 12.15 am. when we were waiting for the shuttle and it din't turn up we asked at the reception and they told us that they never booked a shuttle... wow... that was amazing.. we were about to miss our flight.. then they said we will book them now and suddenly the same company who charged $35 yesterday is $40 per person for us. well we had no option got it booked ... but I would never ever recommend this hotel for the very unprofessional attitude they have... liers.. Also a very big disadvantage is that they are $20 cab ride one way from the city where all the restaurants is and there is not even a single restaurant around...every meal was a $40 plus for commute or local bus $10 per person...   never returning to this hotel. not to forget there were ants every where in the room.. and when you pay for morning buffet breakfast ..not even coffee is included. Also ours was a gold garden view room which was like a cave... no view at all.. and all the golf view rooms were like that,","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",30 December 2013,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",not professional,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1220-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

Heaps of room and lovely and clean. The rooftop spa area is huge - would be great for a party or celebration but as there was only two of us it wasn't utilised. The pool at the resort was great and it is a short walk to the beach. The only negative for us was the Restaurant. We had dinner there on the first night and it was disappointing. It was an odd menu. Nothing on it that we really wanted to eat. We had a cheese board after dinner and it was woeful. The worst I have ever had.

"1,915 reviews",1,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,LouiseSD,10,4.5,"I have never written a poor review for any establishment before but I feel compelled to write about my experience last week as it was truly awful. I stayed in the $1800 per night Penthouse suite last week ""at this supposed 5 star resort"" and was bitterly disappointed as I had THE worst dining experience in the 9 years since I have been living in Australia (and in fact of my life!!!).The head waitress who was serving us was extremely rude and inappropriate. Initially when we entered the restaurant to ask for a table we were rudely shooed away by her and told that she ""couldnt possibly seat us as it was starting to rain"" and ""she was about to lose half her restaurant"". There were only 6 tables being used, over 10 tables free, and only one table which was in the rain and needed to be moved inside. She crassly told us to leave and return 30mins later- which we did. It was a Friday night and we ordered the $150 seafood platter to share between two of us. We were then told that there were no oysters or mussels available and that chef would ""throw on some more calamari and fish"" to make up for it. We had to wait over half an hour to be served our wine (in the end another lovely very polite waiter serving a neighboring table finally saw we had been served our starters and still had no wine and kindly went and got us our wine- it took him about 2 minutes). Our actual waitress then returned and then very rudely and sarcastically asked us ""how is your wine? was it worth the extra 30 second wait?""!! The fish (supposedly nannygai) of which there was only one piece (so much for our extra fish to make up for the lack of mussels and oysters) on our seafood platter was honestly the consistency of a poor cut of beef (for example chuck or round) which had been cooked to the consistency of a well done steak! I have NEVER EVER complained about a meal or sent food back to a chef but this fish was so dry, tough and leathery and I struggled to cut through it (to share with me friend as there was only one piece), let alone chew it! The Morton Bay bugs were also awful- dry and overcooked. About 20 minutes later our waitresses returned without our replacement fish and stated that she ""couldn't find the chef"" to cook us more fish and that "" he must be out having a sneaky drink"" !!! (this is at 21:00 on a Friday night at a 5 star resort!!). Our waitress (who may I reiterate is the Head Waitress and Food and Beverage Manager at the restaurant) then went on a long diatribe about how she is married to a chef but she cant cook ""for [--]"" and how she burnt spaghetti last week! (she continued to ramble on for about 5 minutes- i switched off after about 4 minutes). Eventually we did get a small 6cm piece of ocean trout to replace our ""beef-jerky-fish"" and admittedly it was beautifully cooked and tender. I politely voiced my extreme disappointment with our meal to which our waitress kept giggling and in the end we were given $10 off the $150 seafood platter. Never have I been SO incredibly disappointed with Australian Tourism. The service we received was absolutely APPALLING and unfortunately I have to warn all of my friends who live in Cairns with me (and those visiting) to stay well away from the Port Douglas Pullman Sea Temple Resort and not to waste their money. (Ironically the Pullman Hotel in Cairns has given me some of the most fabulous food I have ever eaten and I cannot recommend it highly enough!!:) This is in fact one of the reasons I was initially very excited to go and stay at the Port Douglas Pullman Sea Temple Resort with me friends.)","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",21 December 2013,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",MY WORST AUSTRALIAN TOURISM EXPERIENCE!!!

We had a huge two bedroom suite with a roof top terrace that unfortunately we didn't have time to use.  If we had stayed longer we would have used the hot tub that was part of the terrace.  This resort is humongous and it takes a while to walk from your unit to the restaurant and also to the pool area.  We used the pool and it was very nice and quite large but not too deep - about chest height for us which I like.  The food is excellent, the staff is very friendly and good.

"1,915 reviews",1,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Sam M,30,4.5,"My wife and decided to stay 5 nights to relax before having our first child in December. Overall we thought the stay was ok, unfortunately there were a few things which could have been better. I don't quite understand the layout of the pool; there is a fabulous lofty, breezy entrance where the reception, restaurant and bar are located which looks out over the pool, however to get to your room you basically exit the place and walk around the entire complex on a paved driveway rather than on a path around the pool. On the first night I thought the bed had not been made properly and on examining in the morning the bottom sheet was not tucked in because it was way too short. Bare mattress on your feet where numerous others have had there's is not entirely what I look for in a five star resort. On leaving a note for housekeeping I thought the issue would be fixed. No. In fact I received the note back pointing out that my request could not be fulfilled because the sheet was too short. I was aware of this fact (obviously). The Pullman has very large labels on its mattresses which state that they are specially made for the resort. My humble suggestion is if you pay the money for the mattresses then buy sheets to match. I wasn't quite aware that such a thing as zip together king mattresses exist; interesting concept but not the most comfortable. Lastly the $5 lamp shade was quite obviously and extensively torn (possibly made from some form of paper substitute) however $5 was not spent to replace it. The housekeeping staff need to be educated as to how their wages get paid. Parking is unclear and we had issues getting our car out due to people parking in the driveways. Front office staff were great, spa was really good size, spa treatments were really good.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",22 September 2013,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Ok but not great,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1270-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",89,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Juztina,30,4.5,"i recently stayed in a 2 bedroom apartment with private plunge pool with 2 other friends. the resort is nice but left us wondering how on earth it received its 5 star rating. the main pool is very nice and impressive when you walk into the resort. it is very big, looks clean and circumvents most of the hotel rooms around the resort that have a swim up option. however, the rooms itself are very simple with cheap fixtures and fittings. they are also not very well kept - our clean feet would be dirty after a few foot steps around the room which you would not expect just moments after checking into a 'clean' room. the accommodation in terms of design and decor is quite simple but i realise this is to compliment the tropical Queensland climate. we arrived late on friday night so the only dining option available was room service as the hotel restaurant, Aqua, stopped serving at 9.30pm. we ordered most of the items off the room service menu as it did not have a very exhaustive (or imaginative) list of food items to choose from. the food arrived quite promptly given the quantity of our order which was a nice surprise. however when the food arrived we were not impressed. the presentation of the food was very poor and what you would expect perhaps from a 24 hour road house diner on the side of a highway in the middle of nowhere, not at a luxury 5 star resort with prices to match. the chips and wedges were served in a floppy cardboard container, as were the stir fried vegetables and rice. the sauces were stacked in  plastic containers one on top of each other similar to how you would find condiments at a fish and chips shop, and our cocktails that we ordered were served in paper milkshake containers with gimmicky palm tree clip art. the room service presentation was woeful, off putting, and disgraceful for a 5 star resort. the taste of the food was ok but we were starving and ready to eat anything at this stage. the chips were warm at best and soggy. the breakfast buffet is limited in choice and presentation very simple and lacklustre. since we were on holiday we decided to each order a bloody mary at breakfast but alas, the bar only opens at 10am (it was about 9.30am when we inquired about the cocktails). so we instead ordered an espresso each which we were later on charged over $4 each for and were not told it would be an extra cost outside the normal breakfast menu which was disappointing. we spent most of the day by the main pool ordering cocktails which were lovely, and then spent some time in our own pool. we ordered an ice bucket for our champagne and waited a long time for it (a whole bottles worth) before having to call them again to remind them to bring it in time for our next bottle. for a recently built, 5 star resort, it was not overly impressive and given its locality 5km out of town, it doesn't really give me a reason to revisit.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",16 September 2013,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",unmet expectations,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1275-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

The 2 bedroom apartment was also lovely with its own prvate plunge pool, BBQ  and kitchen . However  my  criticism would be centred on the bathroom . A single bathroom/toilet is not enough and frankly 1 washhand basin between 4 adults is a nonsense . A comboined bath/shower is also inadequate compared to the single room facilities .  There were also some potemtial privacy problems with the next door unit . Dining was elegant and tasty but pricey . In particular , breakfast was extortionately priced at a minimum $25 per head .

"1,915 reviews",42,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Lynne B,20,4.5,"We booked a 1 week stay at a swimout apartment near lagoon C.  Unfortunately,  we wanted a quiet relaxing holiday and was very disappointed.  For 1 night people stayed above us and all you could hear from 5am was a person walking to and fro whilst they did they washing and re packed. As this area of the lovely lagoon pool is shallow it was popular with many young families and some excitable children, with babies and also people congregating at the bali hut to speak on their mobile phones and drink.  So, the area outside our apartment was like a bar with people looking in.  In fact the bali hut was a communication hub as mobile phone signals and 3g does not work in the apartments.  Also, the apartment was not clean enough, not very dirty but mould in some corners and finger marks on the fridge and kitchen & bathrooms cupboards.  The exhaust fan to the cooker was dirty.  We ordered a cocktail in the bar and had to go back  twice over a period of 30 minutes to ask where it was.  Therefore, we did not try the restaurant, which by the way has a pathway through it where people walk to their apartments...We realise that there needs to be some tolerance however all in all we were disappointed with our stay.  Please bear in mind that the accommodation is a ling way out of Port Douglas and the minibus service is $ 5 per person each way.  Some of the drivers drive fast, seat belts are not enforced and I sat on a seat in white linen pants and someone has spilled coffee on it.  Not happy, so we hired a car at greater cost !! anyway off to Palm Cove tomorrow for 5 days, much more peaceful there.........","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",6 June 2013,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Not 5 star standard,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1340-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

It was a disaster and we immediately checked out and contacted Sea Temple to see if they had anything available for us, with the other option being cancelling our honeymoon. We spoke to the most amazing woman, Jennifer, at Sea Temple front desk who said she could arrange for us to stay in a swim out apartment at a very good rate. From being so sad and disappointed, she really went above and beyond and brightened out spirits. After waiting a few short hours for the new room to be ready, we were called to be told our room was ready. When we opened the door to our apartment, jaws dropped and overwhelmed with gratitude, we had been upgraded to a two bedroom, swim out spa suite, with a personal welcome card and complimentary champagne. We were able to enjoy all the resort has to offer from the food, cocktails, massages and strolls to the private beach.  It was the best holiday and location we have ever experienced. Words cannot express how grateful we are for the amazing, above and beyond service we received at Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple from all of the staff in the day spa, restaurant, house keeping and especially Jennifer.

Upon arriving the staff were very friendly and personally drove us in the little buggy around to our room. We were staying in a Hotel Spa room, which was very nice and had a lovely big bathroom and view over the pool. Our friends had a two storey villa, which was AMAZING!!! The rooms were very nice - but try and get one that overlooks the pool. The resort itself is beautiful, very clean and was relatively quiet when we were there...very kid friendly as well. The buffet breakfast was ok, we recieved a discount as we were part of the wedding party, so only had to pay $20 rather then the normal $35 pp (which I think is far too overpriced) especially as it doesn't include espresso coffee (we had to pay extra for a latte). The pool bar is a nice touch, however a little overpriced and one day it wasn't even open. Pt Douglas main street is about a 7 minute drive away - the resort does have a shuttle bus that comes every 30 minutes, which was great to get back and forth for dinner etc; so you dont feel stuck in the resort the whole time. Overall we had a pleasant stay at the Sea temple.

We asked for a quiet studio room as I had read reviews about noise from pool.  We arrived about an hour before check in time and we were immediately accommodated.  Our room was also upgraded to a king bed (originally had queen) on our request for no extra charge.  (My only complaint was that no one replied to my two email requests so that I didnt have to worry what we were getting).  We got lovely room, great air conditioning (already cool when we entered), huge two person in room spa, comfortable bed.  Drove around to car park outside our unit.  Toiletries in bathroom were nice.  Robes, slippers, safe provided, parking free and plentiful.  Shower grout around bottom could do with scrub but otherwise room was spotless. Mini bar was a bit sparse (no juice, no biscuits to go with tea/coffee).  I wish these five star rated places would supply plunger coffee in the rooms as the instant coffee is really tacky.  Our room had small patio out back but I wish we had been able to screen it off from the passing walkers as they could look direct into room (we had to pull blinds down).  We had lunch at the resort by the pool and both meals were large (chicken caesar salad and fish/salad) and very tasty and fresh.  Service was great.  Resort was quite quiet it seemed with only about a dozen other groups staying and a few families with small children.  Pool looked lovely and if I stayed again, I think I would book a swim-out room.  They did offer laundry service, but would have liked the opportunity to do our own laundry as we had travelled a bit.  Reception staff very attentive and informative on check in and check out.  We had dinner at the resort which was also of high standard.  I didnt think prices were any higher than in Cairns for similar quality meals.

"1,915 reviews",13,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Treloar,50,4.5,"We stayed in room 147 which was a swim out apartment. I would have to say having a swim out is the way to go. You can jump straight in the pool and weave your way around the lagoon into the main pool area which is also massive. It has a central pool bar, but the only down fall with this is that if you do not want to swim to the bar, and you do not have access to one of the bridges which has a path which leads to the main pool area and bar, then you will need to go through your apartment entrance and find the nearest gate to access the bridge. Pretty minor, but still a bit of a nuisance. The whole pool area is massive and photos do not do it justice. It is about a 10 minute drive to Macrossan Street which is the main street with shops, restaurants, but this also is not an issue if you have a car.  All in all, this is an amazing resort and I would definitely want to stay here again.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",22 February 2013,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Amazing pool,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1405-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",640,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,dhen,40,4.5,"First rate hotel. Beautiful grounds with its massive pool as the centerpiece. Many of the rooms back up to the pool which would be perfect if you were traveling with kids. The rooms were modern but with some definate negatives. First, the room was sparsely furnished. Not room for any furniture other than a small sitting table in the corner of the room. As with most of the New Zealand hotels we stayed the bed was a queen size which would not have been our first choice. Another problem was the glass enclosed bathroom. When the light was on in the bathroom it also illuminated the adjacent bedroom. Liked the shower and separate tub. The tub was so massive it took 15 minutes to even partially fill it. Still, the rooms had a very luxurious feel to them. The front desk was very helpful and booked us tickets to the Skyrail and Railway through the Kuranda Rainforest (a highlight of our trip). Our hotel rate for this tour was less than the internet advertised rate. Also thought that the breakfast buffets were first rate. Omelettes were available and were delicious. We also had dinner at the hotel one night and had one of the best meals of our three week trip. We both had the rack of lamb on the menu and it was perfectly prepared and a dining treat. The location was a bit from Port Douglas but there was a shuttle bus that ran about every 1/2 hour, though it was a bit pricey at $9 a person. There were many other very nice resorts closer to town and if you didn't have a car, like us, might be a better option. There were one or two pubs about a 15 minute walk away and the Rainforest Habitat was probably a twenty minute walk away (or $9 shuttle). I also appreciated the small store located next to reception where you buy sundries. Though I only gave Sea Temple a very good, I could have easily given it an excellent rating.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",9 February 2013,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Wonderful Stay,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1415-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

We were under the misunderstanding that this was some type of luxury resort. Our studio apartment (anything larger was superfluous to our needs) had no internal furniture nor stereo. The room service menu (Asian platter) was straight out of Coles deep freeze and our room was not serviced on the first day. Based on the quality of the room service menu, we didn't risk it in the resort restaurant. The staff were pleasant enough although obviously under-resourced. Port Douglas itself seemed to be in some sort of decay. Most of the restaurants seem to be hung up on Asian fusion and the better ones didn't open during the day.

"1,915 reviews",43,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Barbara S,50,4.5,"We had just gotten off our cruise on the Crystal Cruise line in Brisbane and flew to Cairns.  Had a lovely drive along the Coral Sea to Port Douglas about one hour from the airport.  It reminded me of the Amalfi Coast with its winding roads and beautiful scenery. We arrived at the Sea Temple Resport and Spa and were greeted by a very friendly staff member.  All the staff was wonderful and helpful when we arrived.  The opened air lobby had a beautiful view of the very large pool area.  We were driven by golf cart to our room.  My travel agent said she got us a penthouse suite, but when we got into our apartment (which is almost that same size as our apartment in the states) we were astounded by how spacious and beautiful is was.  It is decorated very tastefully with all you could want.  Washer dryer, dishwasher, large refrigerator, microwave.  We could easily have stayed for months.  Not only were the rooms nice, but the verandah was spacious also with a couch, 2 chairs and a table.  Then I noticed a spiral staircase outside and it led to an upstairs that had a hot tub, barbecue grill and table and chairs.  We wanted to move right in.  We were on the second floor and the first floor rooms have access to the lazy river pool right outside their verandah.  There was no direct access from our room to the lobby.  You could walk but it was pretty hot, so you just call the front desk and they come with the golf cart to pick you up.  The staff also helped with setting up tours and gave us some restaurant tips.  Too bad we were only there for 3 days.  We didn't get to see everything we wanted.  Took a shuttle to town one night but it was around 6 and all the stores were closed, which I thought was strange as it is a resort town.  Then I was told it is off season, but we did happen upon a great restaurant called Nautilis which had a long access to the main area but once you get there you think you just entered a tropical jungle.  Beautiful and very romantic.  January is a tricky time of year there, it's hot but it can also be very rainy.  We were lucky that the weather was great when we went to the Great Barrier Reef, but on our last day it rained all day.  All in all it was a very nice way to end our fabulous cruise and stay in Australia.

Overall we were extremely happy with the stay.  The staff were all friendly and nothing was too much trouble.  We had a swim up apartment which was sensational as it meant the adults could relax while the kids were in the pool.  The apartment that we were first assigned was technically a swim up apartment but it was next to a very shallow and narrow end of one of the lagoons off of the main pool near a bridge.  We were all very disappointed as we were expecting to be near the main part of the pool.  We raised this and fortunately were moved to an apartment that faced the middle of the main part of the pool.  We loved this.  If I was to book again I would try to book a specific apartment because there are many ""swim up"" apartments but they are not all as well located as the one we ended up with.

"1,915 reviews",21,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Pingerella,30,4.5,"We decided to book our Christmas lunch for an extravagance and decided that it would be worth the high expense since it was a special day. The menu looked fantastic and we had heard that the resort was luxurious. However, although some of the food was delicious, such as the cold buffet, some of the other food and the carvery was below par. The meat was dry, there wasn't as much choice of veggies and gravy was watery, not what we were expecting for Christmas lunch. Also, the buffet was not replenished very often, with certain dishes and desserts completely running out, which was very disappointing for the price of $135 per person. It was a self-serve buffet, but the waiting staff had to be asked to take away empty plates and drinks were not replenished very often. They also seemed quite surly, not at all in the Christmas spirit which spoilt it a little. And perhaps not as smartly dressed as we would have thought for a resort like this, some wearing scruffy trainers or shorts. We spoke to another group of people who went for lunch and they said the same, so this is not just our opinion alone. The music was great though, the live singer was very entertaining. It was a shame that half of the diners couldn't see the live music, but I guess that couldn't be helped in a large dining area. And I loved the touch of giving us all a little Christmas gift, that was very sweet of them. But overall it was a bit of a disappointment for Christmas day.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",13 January 2013,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Very average rating for the restaurant,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1430-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

I would not go to Sea Temple for a romantic escape without the children. This is because the pool is a fantastic huge play water-filled play area, with a waist-deep lagoon which snakes around the outside of the main pool, surrounded by lush tropical foliage with wooden bridges overhead and handy underwater shelves to sit on and small more secluded areas to throw a ball or splash about. The accomodation that has pool access does really have direct pool access. We were on the first floor so we had to leave our apartment by the main door, go out and down onto the 'street' in front of the apartments and walk round the block to the pool. For us this was fine as the kids could be left  to come and go unsupervised but for younger children it would mean much less flexiblity. We also noted that 2 or 3 of the pool access apartments were occupied by people with wheelchairs while we were there and it was great to see that they could get in and out of the pool with relative ease and at their leisure from their own little patio areas.

"1,915 reviews",21,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,4TravelersEastCoast,40,4.5,"We just returned from our trip to Australia and four nights at Sea Temple. We are a family of 4 with two young adult children (17 & 20) are and our overall vote for this resort is a big ""thumbs up."" We had a glitch upon arrival as we had requested and been assured that our accomodations would include a two bedroom, two bath swim-out apartment. We opened the door to two king size beds but one call to the front desk and the night manager, David, was busy tracking down mattresses so he could switch the bedding. He went out of his way to make sure that we, the customers, were happy. The apartments themselves are nice but the best feature is the swim-out from your patio into the lagoon size swimming pool. I had no idea how large the pool was at this resort from the pictures but it is massive-an water aerobic workout just to do a ""lap"" around it. We loved it and you will too! Other great features-the buffet breakfast-wonderful selections and a great start to the day, the pool bar is fun-nice lunch/snack menu and the drinks are delicious but pricey! The shuttle to town for dinner is convenient but I agree with other reviewers that is does add up at 8 australian dollars round trip per person. It might be worth looking into the price of a rental but I suspect a car will be even more expensive. The resort is on 4 mile beach which is gorgeous but noone swimming due to the stingers. Stinger season runs Dec-May. we did not see any stingers but they make you a little paranoid so we didn't chance it. We did walk the 3 miles on the beach to the the town beach where there are stinger nets (quite genius) and got our fill of ocean swimming. Overall a great time and I recommend this resort to anyone.

My husband went to use the gym on a couple of occasions and was unable to as there were young kids in there just playing on the epuipment. Sea Temple is located so far from town and is really quite painful having to stop at all of the other resorts to get to and from there as it is the furthest one out - shuttle isn't included either. We were so dissapointed and had such great expectations but would never stay there again and would not recommend it to others (unless you have kids).

"1,915 reviews",8,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,BucketListTicker,50,4.5,"My friend and I stayed at the Sea Temple Resort for 6 days, and we loved every minute of it. From the first minute we got there, the staff were (genuinely) very friendly and more than helpful. I booked a Penthouse Suite which was a two level, apartment style room, with a massive upstairs space with a spa and bbq/dining area. When I booked the room (Wotif), it stated it was a 1 bedroom, queen bed arrangement, but upon entering the room, was surprised it was a two bedroom king/queen setup which was even better. We were put in the ""Golfview"" side of the resort, as the desk attendant said it was quieter. And she was right. The room was exceptionally clean, the beds, and pillows, were very comfortable and all the furniture etc was comfortable and very stylish with an Oriental theme throughout. The room had a full kitchen setup and conveniently, a washer and dryer tucked away in a cupboard. Being close to the pool may be better for some, and the resort boasts ""swim out"" rooms, where you can literally walk out your door into the pool, but it isn't as quiet due to kids etc in the pool, but the Golfview rooms are maybe a 1 minute stroll to the pool which is ample. Now for the pool... Stunning! It is a massive saltwater, could be mistaken for freshwater, lagoon pool, that spans almost the entire resort. The entire resort is very modern and Oriental themed and looks really good. The in house Aqua restaurant was very good. From the buffet breakfast to the fantastic dinners, it's well worth a look. They also offer room service 24hours if you feel that way inclined. My friend took advantage of the in house Mii Spa treatments and had nothing but praise about it. If you have a car, there is parking right outside your rooms, which is very handy. Room service comes everyday to refresh your room with new towels etc if you need it. You can walk to Four Mile Beach in a minute or two from the resort, but as we went in November, it was full of stingers, so didn't take advantage of the proximity to the beach, other than to have a walk. I can't think of any bad points about this resort. Maybe the only downside is that, the shower in the room was over the bath, which Im not a fan of, but that in no way detracts anything from what was a fantastic stay at a fantastic resort. I would recommend Sea Temple to anyone. 5*'s!","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",26 November 2012,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Absolutely faultless..

I would recommend a car for your stay here as it is out of town, car parking available, if you choose not to hire car there is a shuttle service for about $4.00 each way. Short trail walk to beach.

Lovely views from the verandah out onto the pool. Very quiet when we first arrived and this created a peaceful, tranquil atmosphere. Unfortunately the quietness did not last for more than one night. Our room overlooked the jucuzzi which was noisy- couples shouted over it and we could hear all of the content of their conversation and there were many noisy children who used it as a children's pool. This situation continued from 7.00am until 1000 pm when the jucuzzi closed. There was also general children's noise around the swimming pool and on one night a private party had been allowed to use the pool area for a party with music and general hubbub! We phoned the management one evening when we had had enough of the noise and they swiftly stopped the children' noise (but they were back thr next morning at 7.00am - the parents were clearly annoyed about the complaint). We also complained about the party but were told that this had been allowed and would stop at 900pm (which did happen). Staff were helpful and the food in the restaurant delicious if expensive. Overall we concluded that we would not go back as we paid alot of money for alot of noise!!We were also there out of season so children seem to be there what ever the time of year. 5 star facilities but poor experience do to the noise.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",3 November 2012,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Amazing penthouse rooms and hotel location but NOISY,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1470-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

Unfortunately this resort seems to have become a favorite destination of families with children under 7. I should have realized we were in trouble as we checked in to see the magnificent pool area full of inflatable plastic creatures. From the moment we checked in we have heard nothing but screaming children and even louder parents. Our beautiful swim out apartment has become the front row seat for a calvicade of children wizzng around like it's a ride at Wet & Wild.

Screaming children everywhere. The area with sun beds allocated to guests who do not have rooms backing on to the pool is not sufficient and we have not been able to enjoy the pool.

The rooms are spacious and well equipped, however the floors felt dirty and the furniture is starting to show effects of wear and tear. The pool is great.

There were glasses smashed and the offenders were extremely noisy, with offensive language till all hours.

In our opinion the management demonstrated indifference stating that people often stay at this resort when attending weddings and party on at the club afterwards.

Yes the studios are small compared with the other suites, though the big spa & bathroom area is quite spacious. The hotel is situated quite a distance from town, however there is a shuttle that runs every half hour from 6am - 11pm. All aspects of this resort are fantastic. You cant not feel relaxed as soon as you walk through the foyer. The pool is enourmous and never ending. The staff were all polite and always eager to help out wherever possible.

If we shut the glass doors, the apartment was almost soundproof. Room service was a bit slow and there wasn't a large variety of food choices. The restaurant was expensive so we only ate there once.

As like all of Port Douglas, there are cane toads everywhere, stay away they are poisonous to human and animals.  Port Douglas is a wonderful town.  If you plan on staying for several days, pay the price for the 5 day or 3 day passes on the shuttle, you will surely use it because you can't walk to places and the town with restaurants and shopping is about 8 minutes away.  There is a grocery store in town also.  We stayed in the two bedroom penthouse and it was magnificent.  Lots of room, private hot tub, rooftop terrace and balcony.  This hotel is great, the staff was wonderful as well.  If you have tendancy to get car sick, take some medication because the trip from cains to port douglas was horrible, lots of winding roads, probably didn't help that our shuttle driver drove like crazy and that I'm not used to being in vehicle driving on the right side of the road.

"1,915 reviews",8,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,jjpapaik,50,4.5,"Stayed in the standard spa room for 3 nights in july. Must say it was pretty amazing. The only annoying thing about our stay was the aircon was turned on by the cleaning staff every day and as it was not very warm when we got home after a day out we had to freeze for a while untill the room adjusted to a suitable temperature. Not a huge hassle. We had 2 for 1 breakfast voucher for the full buffet. It was amazing. HUGE selection, and was great to see that some of the options changed from day to day. No complaints at all, if you get the rooms on sale definately go ahead with it. There was a small hick up with our bill we were charged for mini bar items we did not use, but was promptly resolve by the check out staff. All staff were very friendly. We did find there wasn't enough parking though and when we returned late one night we had to park just on the road basically.

Our room was very close to the pool with only a small garden and grass area between our outdoor area and the edge of the pool. The staff were excellent and very helpful to make sure we enjoyed our stay. The pool was a little cold, but that is probably due to the lack of sun while we were there. The huge pool was a major drawcard for us choosing this resort and didn't disappoint with the kids loving it. The hotel has beach access and you can walk into town along the beach - very nice walk which took about an hour with an 8 year old. The drive to town is only 10 minutes and there is an IGA just around the corner if you are after some groceries but don't want to to into town. The gym has a couple of treadmills, a cross trainer and exercise bike with some free weights and equipment - a little crowded but seemed to work well. We had dinner in the restaurant one night.

Very comfortable and luxurious digs, great pool, pool snack bar and range of yummy cocktails. All the staff were very obliging, friendly and polite. Although breakfast was very good in terms of range and quality we did not eat at the resort apart from the pool bar. The reason -  our room service food on first night was very disappointing. The room service menu was a cut down version of the full restaurant menu and we ordered fairly simple fare - fish and chips, a burger and a salad. The order itself was a bit strange - when I asked for a plain burger the lady that was taking the order kept 'suggestive selling' me cheese/bacon etc etc with the burger. I kept saying 'Just plain. Thanks' and she kept insisting 'just some cheese then?' In the end I relented and said 'Yes' (too tired from the travel to argue). However, when the food arrived it was barely hot and the silly 'cheese' on the burger was positively 'fused' to the meat! so I couldn't remove it. It appears it had been pre-prepared some time earlier which was disappointing and did not taste very well. It kept repeating on me which made me think it was definitely not fresh. Anyway, we ate out every other meal during our week long stay (except for snacks at pool bar which were good).

"1,915 reviews",188,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,amsam,50,4.5,"We returned here for a five night stay during the school holidays, this time with the children. Our last visit was my wife and I and we decided to return with our teenage children, We got a two bedroom swimout apartment and this is what makes it a great hotel. The weather was as tropical as it gets, thunderstorms, winds, sunshine, cloud, humidity and showers every half hour. This did not hinder the great time we had. The apartment allowed us to relax, chill out and wander to the lagoon or pool bar as we so desired. Perfect for doing nothing. The apartment was great, clean, well appointed and the kitchen was a bonus for those daily snacks and for a lazy breakfast. A few negatives; we had to change rooms on day 3, we knew this at time of booking though the hotel could not have coordinated this any worse, they basically wanted us to checkout and re check in a few hours later, to which i objected, we were without a room for an hour or so during a thunder storm. The service at Aqua, the restaurant was very slow. On one evening when we went for desert only. It took them over half an hour to take our order and almost that again to bring it out, they apologised for their unacceptable service (without prompting) and offered half our order complimentary, which I thought was appropriate and appreciated. Johnathon at the pool bar was always whipping up cocktails and keeping us entertained.

The check in staff were very nice but not very knowledgeable about the local area as when we asked what we could do for 2hrs as we did arrive early and our room wasn’t ready yet the response was go into town (I could have told me that) and we were then able to go to the room.  We stayed in a penthouse apartment that had a private spa on the roof.  The room is fantastic and was very clean.  Then we went upstairs to see the spa.  What greeted up was a huge roof area with the spa.....unfortunately the tiles were covered in mould and although I am aware that it is the tropics and mould is everywhere it looked like it hadn’t been cleaned since the beginning of the wet season.  ,"Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",5 April 2012,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",A bit of let down...,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1575-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",140,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,wishIcouldretire,40,4.5,"We had booked a 2 bed apartment for 3 of us with plunge pool ""overlooking the golf course"" but actually it overlooked a road first... then a golf course in the distance.... we didn't like it - the plunge pool was smaller than it looked in the picture and it was completely shaded with so many plants that worried about getting bitten. There were only 2 loungers with no room for a third even though it was a 2 bed apartment. Inside the apartment it smelt very strongly of bleach / jeyes fluid as if maybe trying to keep insects out. We drove back to reception and asked if we could be moved. It was only 40% full so there was plenty of availability. We couldnt decide between a swimout or a penthouse but they said a swimout would cost $50 a day more. It would have been nice if the extra cost could have been waived as we wasted a couple of hours looking at other places and moving etc....  and it was our anniversary and my daughters birthday ....but they dont seem keen on upgrades even though we were paying a high rate ($370 per night I think) so anyway we opted for a penthouse near the lagoon at no extra cost and it was beautiful. Penthouse had a hot tub which wasnt hot and didnt really bubble - we asked them to take a look at it but we dont know if they couldnt fix it or if it was supposed to be like that. Penthouses have a BBQ which we did on a couple of evenings (there is a Coles supermarket in Port Douglas and a liquorland too which was great to stock up with some really good deals! hic !). Lovely view off the balcony and no nasty bleach smells. The only critisism was that the master bedroom had a small bed (a 'large double' ) and my daughter had a large king bed in the second bedroom which was rather odd. Someone came and aknowledged it was indeed a ""very small bed"" and even the headboard was much bigger on the sides but then the manager apparently said it was normal to have bigger beds in the second bedrooms as they were used to split into 2 single beds.  If we had noticed before we unpacked we would have switched rooms and we were offered another move to an apartment with a King bed in the master bedroom but we really couldnt be bothered so we were rather squashed for most of the time and when I wanted a better nights sleep I slept with my daughter ! Big pool was fabulous. Bar didnt open until 12.00 but that didnt really bother us.

"1,915 reviews",1,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,John D,30,4.5,"After a satisfactory stay here in 2011 we decided to return for a short stay 31March/4 April 2012.The accommodation itself, a one bedroom penthouse suite, was very satisfactory and worthy of the property's five star rating, the only drawback being the lack of a seperate shower - rather difficult for seniors like ourselves to climb over the lip! After eating out in Port last time we stayed we decided that this time we would give the inhouse restaurant [Aqua] a try for main meals at dinner. Big mistake! The meal on the first night was the most atrocious meal I have had in a supposedly first class restaurant in years, so bad that we refused to eat there again. Its low standard was highlighted by us searching out a restaurant in the same price bracket in downtown Macrossan Street and partaking of two incredibly good meals of a standard that would do justice to a top rated capital city restaurant charging twice the price. One small beef, which I have found in other Mirvac operated establishments and no doubt others as well, is the practice of charging the fee for payment by credit card as a percentage of the total bill. This is nothing more than a rip off. The costs associated with processing a credit card transaction is the same regardless of the size of the bill. This resort has everything going for it except the restaurant.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",4 April 2012,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ","Excellent accommodation, shame about the restaurant",https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1580-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

Our room had the biggest jacuzzi bath I have ever seen in a hotel.  Two of us had plenty of room and we could have added a couple of children.  There were many young couples here, often with children, but not in numbers or noise that detract from the enjoyment of older couples.  Our room joined a 2 bedroom suite with kitchen and the entire 3 bedroom suite shared a courtyard with grill, table for 6, small pool with chaises and outdoor lounging chairs, tables and sofa.  Our group enjoyed a barbie.  Grabbing a sunset cocktail at the pool bar and walking the lagoon was a favorite early evening activity.

We are so glad we did, the weather was perfect. The resort is well planned and maintained. We had a three bedroom penthouse apartment for four nights which was booked through the apartment owners', and not the resort itself - a fact we didn't know until we got there. This meant being met by the booking agent for check in, (key handover) and not checking in at the resort desk. It also meant that if we had any queries or problems throughout our stay, that we would contact the booking agent and not the concierge or front desk. Our room included a rooftop spa and BBQ and not direct access to the pool which really wasn't a problem as the pool is very easily access able anyway. Being summer the rooftop spa wasn't very refreshing so we didn't bother using it, but the BBQ got a great workout. The kitchen was very clean with an oven big enough to accommodate our needs. Although this resort has a shuttle bus, I recommend car hire for the convenience of it and also the time saving factor. Why spend time in the shuttle bus when you can laze around the pool drinking cocktails. Give yourself plenty of time when ordering drinks, on the first day our drinks took two and a half hours to arrive, apparently the barman didn't have enough glasses despite the being used glasses and plates lying around waiting for clean up from areas of private access from ground floor rooms.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",21 February 2012,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",what a way to spend the weekend,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1595-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",3,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,AngelEspana,50,4.5,"We booked in at the Sea Temple after turning up at our first choice and being disappointed. We booked at the 11th hour on Booking.com and were pleasantly surprised at the quote of $199 AUD for that night. The wow factor started as soon as we arrived - a beautiful open-air lobby, huge exotic pool and gardens and really friendly front desk staff.  Sometimes when we've booked last-minute special-rate rooms there seems to be a slight change in attitude of the staff at some hotels.  Not so here. The room we were provided was a gorgeous studio with a huge spa bath, extremely clean and with very contemporary furnishings. We chose to stay an additional night and were graciously told by the lovely woman at reception that she'd call me right back regarding availability. In fact what she said was 'unfortunately we may have to move you to another room but I'll call you back with a solution.'  What a great response:  for someone to actually let you know that they're going to find a solution! She called back within 5 minutes and apologized that they would indeed have to move us...but as compensation she wanted to offer us an upgrade to a luxury 2-bed, 2-bath penthouse suite with private roof terrace that had its own jacuzzi, etc. at no extra charge. I can't tell you how blown away we were when we walked into this 'room' which was literally a luxury condo. Pristine, beautifully decorated with a fully equipped designer kitchen and not one but TWO beautiful terraces (a spiral staircase led up to the private upper deck with full jacuzzi, bbq, teak loungers and table for 6). All for $199.  They even offered to move us from one room to another. Luxury accomodation are wonderful but what really makes a difference is service.  These folks have it completely sussed and we'll look forward to returning - even at a much higher rate.  Thank you to Laura Flanagan at reception for taking such good care of us.

Our apartment (2 bdm Swimout Apartment) was privately owned and the booking was made through ""Boutique Collection"".  Our apartment was lovely and had everything you needed including all cooking utensils and lots of extra things provided for you to use that are not normally supplied in resorts - we gather this is because of the unit being privately owned and through Boutique Collection.  The pool is the best we have ever seen and is definitely a top rated pool.  Lovely resort and the location of the resort wasnt a problem for us as we had a hire car.  We were very impressed with the service Boutique Collection gave and especially Carolyn.  We will definitely be returning to the resort and booking through Boutique Collection again.

We had a car and it was great. They have free parking for you and some under cover as well.  The pool is vast and very, very pretty. The internet is only by cable. There is no wireless, so iPad and iPhone works only around the pool and lobby.  It does lack sunbeds & towels. The food by the pool and the Aqua restaurant is not like other resorts where the food is amazing and worth the crazy prices . I suggest going into PD for that stuff.  Staff are not overly friendly, but they do do the job, I guess. The NYE party which we booked was dead by 9:30pm. The buffet was $140 each, it included a welcome beverage and a buffet style dinner. The food was less than average.  The seafood area comprised of cold bugs, oysters and prawns and one cooked fish. The scallops area (cooked) was very popular, but  under serviced. The poor cook was overworked and had to leave the station to get more scallops. Meat buffet area was not very tasty and the cook there was rude. That was it! We finished our dinner by 7pm and then retreated to the bar area (which was dead). We were the only ones there. The band as a soloist singer on karaoke style stage. She was average.

On the third occasion as a family with a 2 year old we had a 2 bedroom close to the pool rented via stayaz rather than the hotel it was a great location again. ,"Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",18 November 2011,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Great family holiday,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1635-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

Go for the hot tub and loungers on the roof if you can - I think this outweighs being able to get straight into the pool from your balcony. It also opens up a whole extra level to the apartment. The attention to detail is amazing, down to having a washing machine and tumble dryer in the apartment. We really didn't want to leave. It beat the rubbish Mandalay and Shalimar hands down and was half the price for a truly 5 star experience.

I recommend grabbing a coffee from the bar. The barista's produce a mean cup (ask for a double shot). There are lots of places just to lounge around. It would be very pleasant to come here for a longer stay with a couple of good books.

Unfort. we stayed at the beginning of the school holidays and if you have kids then a great place as the pool is large enough. However people can then swim right past your unit and this happens until 10pm! There were teenagers yelling and having fun but it seemed right outside our door!We thought both the restaurant and in room menu was very limited and breakfast was poor and expensive for what they offered.The spa is lovely and well worth a visit but even from there we could hear the kids in the pool! Next time we will stay at a smaller resort or an aprtment down at the beach and a bit closer to Pt Douglas as this is 5kms out and so takes a bit of time on the bus to get to and from the resort.,"Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",2 July 2011,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Dont stay here if you want privacy!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1670-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",113,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Lily_Was_Here,50,4.5,"The Sea Temple at Port Douglas is everything it should be. We spent five very relaxing days and nights in a two-bedroom 'penthouse' apartment overlooking the lagoon pool. We had booked a one-bedroom apartment so were surprised to discover we had two bedrooms. The apartment was amazingly spacious, had a large balcony with comfortable chairs/lounge, and a large rooftop terrace with lounges, an outdoor setting, BBQ and a four-person jacuzzi. We also had an ensuite to the master bedroom with a two-person spa (perfect size) and a separate bathroom. We could easily move in! The kitchen was great, with Blanco appliances and even a laundry in a cupboard. Faultless. Our only complaint would be the dinner music - for two nights - including the night of my birthday where we had dinner at Aqua (the resort's restaurant) - there was an American flautist playing along to the power ballads of the 60s and the 70s. While the elderly couple at the adjacent table appeared to enjoy it, it was way over the top and totally opposed to our tastes in music. Given the majority of the hotel clientele are in their 30s and 40s, it seemed an odd choice, to say the least. The music played in the gorgeous Mii Spa was much better. Thank goodness - it meant we could enjoy our treatments, which were just sublime. The staff in the resort and the spa were simply wonderful and it's lovely to experience such good service in an Australian resort. Five stars for sure.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",20 June 2011,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",As good as the website says it is...except maybe the dinner music,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1670-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

In fact it should be faultless, but it wasn't. The one TV in our 2 bedroom apartment rattled when on, and the aerial plugs in the bedrooms just served to emphasize the absence of TVs in those rooms. There was no wifi internet access in the room and 2 blinds were faulty. A terracotta paver around the spa was missing and was not replaced during the 6 days we stayed there. None of these things are major but at more than $700 a night for our apartment I think the resort should be beyond reproach. A lovely place to stay if someone else is paying!

"1,915 reviews",43,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,sweetpea_me,40,4.5,"My husband and I stayed here for 3 nights on our recent 3 week trip to Australia. We stayed in a spa studio room, on the ground floor. Room was large with a small fride in the bedroom (which seems to be common in Australia) and a spacious bathroom. Everything was very modern, new and fresh and kept very clean. The resort contains many apartments which seem to be owned by people and rented out via the main hotel, it therefore has a somewhat impersonal feel at times although this didn't bother us. The recption was a lovely, open plan area with friendly staff. Pool area was lovely too with plenty of free sun longers when we were there. We had breakfast once in the hotel which was adequate but not worth the $30 (you can get a much better breakfast in town in a cafe for quite a bit less). The only drawback to this hotel is that it's about 6km outside the town centre. We had a car and drove into town every night for dinner. As I'm pregnant and not drinking this wasn't a problem but wouldn't have been as much fun if both of us had wanted a couple of glasses of wine with dinner. There is however a shuttle bus which seems to pick people up from all the hotels and drop them in town. When I booked this hotel originally the cost was c. $250/night, I happened to check the hotel's website about 10 days before our stay and managed to get a rate of about $160/night, so might be worth checking if you do stay there.

Although it was a little bit risky , due to the possibility of often rainfalls in that period, we have been very lucky in all senses. The weather was perfect and give as a chance to enjoy one of the most beautiful swimming pools we ever seen . The Sea Temple is more a residence than a hotel but has all the facilities of a very good hotel and the staff is very kind, professional and friendly. It's a new structure, very clean, well manteined and very cool designed. The room was clean too and spacious.Close to the hotel it's located a nice and long sandy beach which is worth to visit too . The Sea Temple is in some way a little bit isolated, but is anyhow well connected to Port Douglas with a minibus service almost every 30 minutes. Finally  if someone will ask me if it's reccomended to go there I'll answer YES  without any doubt. Just enjoying  the outside Jacuzzi under the moon is worth a visit there! Last but not least the quality of the restaurant it's very high and with our much regret it's something that we haven't found easily in other hotels during our journey.You will not be disappointed !!!!!","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",23 December 2010,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Great experience !!!!,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1705-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

"1,915 reviews",11,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,kazy71,50,4.5,"My Husband and I celebrated our wedding anniversary in a one bedroom penthouse, wow it was everything in the photos plus more.  As soon as I walked into the room I was immediately impressed and Annie did such a wonderful job filling all my requests which was a wonderful surprise as well as a bottle of wine with a card and that was a nice touch.  The views were awesome and the room was immaculate beautifully furnished.  The balmy nights swimming, dining on the roof and enjoying our spa.  The pool is massive and a wonderful feature in the resort.  How nice it was going out to a full day to come back to a lovely cool clean room with no worries and a paper every morning.  I really got use to the idea of not having to clean, pickup and wash all the time, having the advantage of fresh towels, pool towels, and beds made, it is a break away from home in itself.  I have stayed in a 5 star in Bora Bora and yes I would defiantly say this is 5 star.  The service we hand was top rated Gina helped in anyway possible and provided great service always with a lovely smile, and Anthony he was great too I loved his honesty and knowledge of dining to activities nothing was too much trouble and his warm personality they both made you feel like youve know them personally for years, Ive always believed the resort or the accomodation one chooses will reflect on ones holiday, and I have to say Ive been to many places and the services I got from Annie, Anthony and Gina have been the best.  For years Ive travelled to fiji with our daughter it seems cheaper with children to go overseas.  But I truly loved this resort so much my husband and I would love our daughter to experience what we did.  So yes somehow some way we are returning next year.  A holiday is what you make it and the Sea temple Port Douglas certainly is there for a relaxing and a pampered holiday.  Feel free to ask me anything.  Gee Im still rocking from the Quicksilver I went out on 15 to 20 winds I even took kwells.  If your interested in Hartleys crocodile farm I will write a review on that one.  I also went to Sea temple palm cove so if anyone wants to know the difference I'm more than happy to help.  So going to Sea temple I defiantly liked the penthouses with huge rooms and roof.  I also loved the beach shack try it.  So once again a big thankyou to Annie, Anthony and Gina for making truly a special holiday (I suppose the word is incrediable staff go for the payrise lol). The Sea Temple wont disappoint, we also hired a car which was really good the freedom to come and go and really by the time you pay $8 return pp everytime going into town as well as tours, we got a new elantra for $33 a day from east coast car hire they had better rates and that included cheaper excess.

"1,915 reviews",1,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,damian4,40,4.5,"We've just come back from a one week stay at Sea Temple Port Douglas and it was brilliant. I had read some reviews previous to our departure which were sligtly negative (unclean rooms, non helpful staff), but we could not fault the resort or the staff at all. We travelled with our 4yr and 2yr old, and it was just as much fun for them as it was for us. They spent much of the day playing in and around the pool, and they loved the Spa! We stayed in a 2bed penthouse with the private rooftop spa terrace. It was fantastic. The added space on the roof meant we could run around with the kids while cooking a BBQ lunch, or using our own private spa. The beach was just a 1min walk away, and while 4mile beach is not one of the best beaches around, it still provided lots of fun for the kids, especially at low tide when they could walk well out and explore. We had a car for the week so ate in town every night. We provided our own breakfast, but did have lunch at the pool bar a few times (which was great). If you are travelling with kids you should probably have a car at your disposal as the resort is only a 5min drive out of town, but relying on the shuttle bus could take some fun out of it, and probably take each trip 30mins. The room was serviced each day, and the staff were always very friendly and very helpful. We had an early flight which got us into the resort well ahead of checkin, we did not request an early checkin, but when we arrived they did their best to accomodate us. We waited in town for only an hour when they called to say our room was ready. That was well above the call of duty and we much appreciated it. When our daughter misplaced her goggles, the pool bar staff and reception did their upmost to track them down and got them back to us!! So a big thankyou to all the staff that helped make our stay so enjoyable.

The staff all seemed as though they were new when we stayed with little knowledge but went out of their way to find the answers to our questions. Breakfast was a bit average for the $30 a head each. Better option would have been to go room only and just eaten out each morning. The pool is amazing and service is great. The pool bar seemed to close very early (6pm) on some nights even though there were a few of us still hanging around.

"1,915 reviews",80,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Mumma_Katherine,50,4.5,"Left dreary, freezing, 15 degree Melbourne and arrived 3 hours later in 31 degree paradise! Picked up rental car from Cairns airport and made the easy drive (just under an hour) to Port Douglas.  Sea Temple was a little bit tricky to find - we drove in and knew it would be great.  We rented a 2 bedroom apartment through a real estate agent and saved a great deal of $$ per night. We set up a tab with the resort so we could still charge things to our room and settled this on departure.  The apartment was beautiful, lovely furnishings and very clean - I am very fussy and had no problem at all.  Yes the apartments are a little dark, but that's what lights are for, anyway, who wants to hang out inside all day when you are in Port Douglas!  The pool was a 30 second walk away and the kids loved this, they could pop back to the apartment for a drink, food or more pool toys - very convenient for me as I could stay on my sun lounge!  As for crowding, we were there during school holidays and there were a lot of people.  However, we never missed out on finding a spot to sit and the pool bar staff were so lovely and always helped others find a spot if they were unsure of where to sit.  Other holiday makers were friendly and our kids had a ball making friends in the pool - they shared their toys, played ball and loved every minute.  By the way, the pool is HUGE and beautiful, especially at night when they light the flames in the middle.  We took our dinner out there one night and sat, it was delightful.  The staff were all great - very helpful, friendly and accommodating.  I have noted some negative comments from other visitors - didn't experience anything negative during our stay. However, it made me cringe a few times the way some visitors treated the staff, very rude and precious - maybe that's why some people have a bad time? We had a hire car the whole time and found popping down the street for shopping or dinner easy - quite liked not being to close to it all.  The beach is very close, didn't swim there, but went for lovely walks.  My husband loves golf and the course is terrific - look out for the resident crocodile living in water holes 9/10!! There is a shuttle bus from reception to the golf course.  We loved the cafe style restaurant at the golf course, huge verandahs with sublime view over the course (lots of Monarch butterflies) - we ate there are few times.  The restaurant in Sea Temple is very nice, but a little bit too expensive for families to eat in every night - food lovely.  Would be good if there was a less formal dining option available, however, we enjoyed going into town and trying the wonderful restaurnats there - On the Inlet was our favourite.  Port Douglas was fantastic and Sea Temple the icing on the cake - loved it.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",14 October 2009,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Fantastic family holiday in the sun.,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1765-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

The snacks available at the bar took forever to arrive and cost almost as much as the airfare.  There was no internet cover in the rooms, and only one working computer in the lobby to use (with a time limit).  Pretty archaic for a 5 star resort.  The  holiday only got better when a Subaru national conference took place and we were unable to get our vehicle out of the garage due to all the Subarus parked around the entire resort, and then unable to use the restaurant or pool due to their function.

Then she read some reviews here on TripAdvisor that made it look less than promising.  She was really concerned that the hotel was going to be awful.  All I can say is: ""don't believe everything you read"".  Our stay in Sea Temple was excellent.  The staff was great, the room was great and the location was great.  It is located in a quiet area, is very near the beach (out the gate, down the little path and voila!) and was extremely relaxing.  We decided to go to Port Douglas to get a little away time while visiting friends and Sea Temple was the perfect escape.  I'd never been to the Great Barrier Reef and really wanted to go snorkling.  The hotel arranged everything for us with no problems...even though we waited until we arrived to book a dive! (someone had said we should wait till we got there as the weather was variable)  Any issues or questions we had were dealt with promptly and efficiently. If we called the front desk for something they would be knocking on the door almost immediately (no mean feat since we had a room at the relative back of the property.)  One night one of the neighboring rooms was having a rather loud party, we were courteous and let them go on for a while, but at 11:00 we said ""ok, that's enough"" and called the front desk.

"1,915 reviews",46,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Vegetarian_Aussie,40,4.5,"We stayed at the Sea Temple for one night because I had always wanted to experience a swim-out room.  It was far too expensive for us to consider staying any longer.  I have very mixed feelings about this hotel.  The pool was enormous, very visually impressive & attractive and the kids (aged 8 & 6) loved it - even though it was COLD.  I believe that - even in far north Queensland - hotel pools need to be heated in winter.  The restaurant was quite nice but again I thought too expensive and, as vegetarians, the dinner options were very limited.  I always love the buffet breakfasts at big hotels and this one was no exception - but at around $100 for the 4 of us it was hideously overpriced.  Given we had paid around $600 for one night in a 2-bedroom swim-out room, I think breakfast should have been included.  I was also disappointed when, after checking out, I realised I had left my expensive moisturiser in the room.  I contacted the hotel within an hour or two of leaving, intending to drive back and get it, but house-keeping were ""unable to locate it"".  Uh-huh.  So, overall, I'm glad we experienced ""how the other half live"" for one night, and the kids certainly had a ball - but would I stay at the Sea Temple again?  Probably not.

I had read reviews about the resort being too big and initally i was surprized there was no direct access from pool bar to lobby but the walk there really isnt that much further than a direct route. i guess i was a tiny bit disappointed that the pool bar wasnt ""in"" the water but we were able to sit in the water with our drinks so it didnt matter in the end and the bar staff were excellent. The fact that it is out of town really isnt an issue as when you book accom it is there in black and white to see location, plus there are regular (hourly/half hourly) buses for $4 into/of out town.   Would definately stay again.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",4 March 2009,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",beautiful place to relax,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1790-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

The rooms were large enough for an apartment complex and the kitchen well set out. The staff were al friendly but the kids were especially impressed with Pan, the pool barman who was a ""mixologist"" and managed to throw a few bottles around and make a mean kids mocktail.

"1,915 reviews",1,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,ants73,30,4.5,"We stayed at the Sea Temple during March 08 for our 10 yr wedding anniversary. Our expectations were high as it is classed as a 5 star hotel and the website makes it look fabulous. The foyer of the hotel is wondeful and I was very excited when we checked in. We had booked a 2 bedroom swim out apartment. When we finally found our room I can tell you my heart dropped. The smell that came out of the room once the door opended was a terrible musky smell that stayed in the back of my throat for quite a while. I thought it may just need some airing out. I walked accross to the outdoor patio and the condition of the sofas was terrible. They were all stained and it was not made up properly. When I went to sit down no less then 2 bugs lept out from the side of the sofa.  Hubby got the bug spray and sprayed them. I then went to sit inside and can you believe it another bug came out from the inside sofa. I had enough!! The cobwebs under the stools were like they had been there for months and the deck chair cushions outside were full of mould and moss. I can understand bugs outside in a tropical climate but not inside. I went to complain to the manager who then went to inspect the room himself and totally agreed that it was not acceptable. After waiting 2 hours they finally moved us to another room. There was still a slight smell, but I think this has got to do with the humidity and close proximity to the pool and garden beds just outside the doors. The room was clean. They made sure of that!

We had the magnificent pool to ourselves most of the time.  The weather in January was a bit unpredictable but overall, very warm.  The units are located a bit far from the lobby so you will have to walk to your room each night.  There are some shortcuts, but the walk is still farther than most hotels.

"1,915 reviews",211,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Merry N,50,4.5,"Stayed at Sea Temple for two nights in November with husband and two children (8 and 10) and had an amazing time.  Absolutely loved the simplicity of the design of this hotel and the rooms. Symmetry is all around and helps to give a relaxing feel.  Beautifully maintained tropical gardens set the scene. Front entrance is enticing, furnishings are very ""designer"" and tropical and we all couldn't wait to get into the pool.  Love the burning flames from the pillars in the pool at night also.  You can swim forever in the lagoon pool, as my children did, around and around the resort, only coming back for a quick break and an icecream before they were off again.  Need I say that they were exhausted at night, but still swam until 10pm.  Gave me time to relax and read my mags.  Ate at the restaurant for breakfast and dinner which was great.  Good modern menu as you would expect.  Would have loved to stay for a week or two to fully use apartment facilities.  Kitchen was well equipped, modern and new.  Great gift shop which was very reasonable (normal retail prices) for equatorial type homewares, beach clothing etc.  Friendly front desk, but could do with extra staff, all guys seemed to be constantly busy, but not impolite.  Excellent place for a family holiday or even just for couples I would imagine.

"1,915 reviews",75,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Trainers1,50,4.5,"The Sea Temple was recommended by a friend - and is probably one of the loveliest hotels we've ever visited. The decor is understated and elegant, the staff are helpful - and it's only a couple of minutes walk along a boardwalk to a stunning stretch of beach. Our room was a 'swim-out' option, which gives you direct access into the swimming pool. Rooms are fabulously well-equipped, with a small kitchenette and laundry area at one end of a very long living room, with large dining table, comfy sofas and terrific view out into the hotel pool and vegetation. The Sea Temple is on a regular shuttle bus route for two local companies, with coaches which go into Port Douglas - about five minutes away - where you can enjoy a whole range of seafood restaurants. We can't speak highly enough of the staff who made sure we got to the Outer Barrier Reef for some fantastic snorkelling. We'd planned to go later in the week, but the reception team told us the weather was worsening, and that our best chance would be to replace our planned trip that day with a boat excursion to ensure we'd see some fish. In 10 minutes, they'd rearranged our planned trip to the rainforest to another date, booked us a place on the Calypso (highly recommended), arranged a hotel car to take us to the jetty and packed it with towels.  Wonderful service - all carried out with a smile and no sense of fuss.

"1,915 reviews",1,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,drewmess78,20,4.5,"The sea temple is a beautiful resort.  That being said, we would never go back.  To start, the sheets at this place were so rough they were like sleeping on sandpaper.  They were so uncomfortable that my wife put the bathrobe down on top of her side of the bed and slept on that.  The next problem was that the resort is very poorly planned out.  The pool is huge and beautiful but if you are staying on or are just at the pool bar area, there is no convenient way to get the lobby/restaurant area without walking around the outside of the entire resort complex.  There are very few sun loungers by the main pool area and many times people had to wait to get a place to sit by the pool.  They charge a $5 fee to get lunch from the pool bar b/c the restaurant is far from the pool bar and the restaurants kitchen is where the pool bar food comes from.  $5 is not a big deal but the food is pricey to start and they should just build that $5 charge into the price of food (so that it is less obvious).  We didn't use the internet at the resort b/c it was $15 for a half hour of internet.  It was $4 for a half an hour at an internet cafe in town and by comparison, at a major luxury hotel in Sydney it was $5 for half an hour.  $15 for half an hour of internet is just price gouging and trying to get as much money from customers as possible.  This is not what I would expect from a luxury resort.  The people who work at the resort are nice and do their best to be helpful but the resort is definitely not well managed.   On our first night at the resort we were told we could not eat dinner at their restaurant b/c we did not have a reservation.   I was shocked because its a big restaurant and a hotel should figure out how to accomodate its guests.  We checked in at 2 PM and no one said anything about needing a reservation for dinner.  On our first morning at the resort we went to the pool and their were no pool towels.  When we asked for towels they didn't get to the pool for over an hour.  That's not what I expect from a luxury resort.  While we were waiting for the towels there were resort staff cleaning the glass wall surrounding the pool for about an hour.  This left me with the impression that they cared more about making the resort look nice than the service of guests.  I think this is because they are still trying to sell apartments at the resort.","Mitre St,Port Douglas, Queensland 4877, ,Australia",26 August 2007,,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,Queensland,Hotel," of 42 , of 42 ",Sleeping on Sandpaper!,https://www.tripadvisor.com.au/Hotel_Review-g255070-d619468-Reviews-or1840-Pullman_Port_Douglas_Sea_Temple_Resort_Spa-Port_Douglas_Queensland.html

When you arrive at this hotel, it feels like you’ve come to an oasis. All of the facilities are just spectacular. No complaints about the mattresses here. All of the staff went out of their way for us. It does seem like they are short staffed in the food and housekeeping areas. The staff works hard to make up for deficiencies in those. It seems like refinement is needed on their processes, training and staffing so that less issues occur rather than needing to spend so much effort on fixing problems. I made our reservations for 16 just after they opened last year. As you can imagine, there were many follow-up and service related issues that are typical in a new hotel. The groups manager, Chloe Larson, really want out of her way to resolve room configuration issues that were problematic from our reservations made by the prior group manager. She put four of us in a villa. What a place! The 16 of us had quiet a combination birthday/departure party on our last night in Australia. Several members of our group were in swim out apartments. Everyone, including those in studios loved their rooms. Despite the many service issues, we would all stay there again.

The resort is a 5 minute drive up to the main street and we kept our hire car from the airport for the whole week. The room was spacious, new and high quality fittings, clean and well maintained. The room was serviced daily. In the penthouse suites there is a roof top spa and BBQ which we did not use but looked good and might be handy. Other suites have a swim out to the pool and we think that next time we will try to book such a room as it would be great. It would be important to ask for a room where the balcony / swim out gets sun so that you can lie on the sunlounges.The pool area is the best feature of this resort. It is an enormous lagoon type pool with shallow areas and it worked well for lying on a sunlounge while our 2 children waded at the pool edge. There is a pool bar which serves drinks and food from the restaurant. Fairly expensive and not so kid friendly menu but we kept snacks and icecreams in our fridge so we could pop up and grab a snack for the kids. The pool is not heated and was a bit too cold. Our kids still wanted to swim so one of us had to brave the water and you do get used to it. There is also a large warm/hot spa pool. There is a fairly basic gym. Direct path to the beach just a few minutes walk. The beach was quite nice. We had daily full buffet breakfast included in our room rate and the breakfast was great with very good service. We also dined one evening at the restaurant and enjoyed our meal very much. We were early as we had our 2 children with us. They have a kids menu which was good and the food was all delicious. We found the prices compared well with other restaurants we ate at in Macrossan street. Otherwise we drove up to Macrossan street for dinner.  We also had great meals and kid friendly service and meals at Zinc and Zeus (greek). Overall we had a lovely holiday in Port Douglas. The weather was warm about 26 degrees and the evening mild, no need for jackets.

We had a swim in/swim out room w/a kitchen and laundry facilities. The staff couldn't have been nicer. We had a family, but I'd probably recommend for everyone. If you do get a swim in/swim out I would opt for one more off the beaten track as people could be swimming by your place all day and it wouldn't be that private. We had a nice alcove and plenty of privacy. The staff helped us book day trips and they were very knowledgeable and VERY pleasant.

We originally booked a studio, which was stunning but we really needed laundry facilities as we had been away for two weeks by then. A quick call to reception and for an extra $120 per night, we upgraded to a two bed swim out apartment. It was well worth the extra cost. The apartment was huge and had a full kitchen which is great if you are feeling lazy and want to eat in. The maid even emptied the dishwasher for us! We ate in the hotel restaurant one night and that was very nice and fairly reasonable in price too.

We spent a month in Australia travelling around for our honeymoon and this by far was the best hotel we stayed at. We were only sorry we hadn't booked to stay longer. The hotel is only about 7 months old and is immaculate. Our room was gorgeous (especially the huge jacuzzi bath) and we could walk right out on to a private patio and in to the pool. The pool is absolutely huge. The restaurant food was exquisite (although there is only one restaurant and the menu isn't very long so you will probably want to catch the bus in to Port Douglas to eat if staying for more than a couple of days). The staff and serivce were great.

"1,915 reviews",32,Pullman Port Douglas Sea Temple Resort & Spa,abbache,40,4.5,"This is a great resort if you like luxurious living. The rooms were nice (and we only got a studio), very comfortable bed, awesome jacuzzi bathtub and great pool. Service was surprisingly good, since we'd heard some bad things prior to coming. Very accomodating staff. You also get your own little garage for your car. The negatives, they provide robes which is like putting sandpaper to your skin, there are sugar ants that may invade your room in the summer (which they do give you spray for if you get them - we had them just one night). Limited menu if you're a vegetarian (so just go into ""town"") and lastly, this place is in the middle of NO WHERE. Off the main street, there's one sign to turn and then no others... we found the golf club and had to go ask where to go from there... they do not make it easy to find. (The manager told me ""Yes, I know, but it's worth it once you get there."" hmmmm.)
